											TED has already persuaded me
to change my life in one small way,
											by persuading me to change
the opening of my speech.
											I love this idea of engagement.
											So, when you leave here today,
											I&#39;m going to ask you
to engage or re-engage
											with some of the most important
people in your lives:
											your brothers and sisters.
											It can be a profoundly
life-affirming thing to do,
											even if it isn&#39;t always easy.

											This is a man named Elliot,
											for whom things were very difficult.
											Elliot was a drunk.
											He spent most of his life
battling alcoholism,
											depression, morphine addiction,
											and that life ended
when he was just 34 years old.
											What made things harder for Elliot
is that his last name was Roosevelt.
											And he could never quite
get past the comparisons
											with his big brother Teddy,
											for whom things always seemed
to come a little bit easier.

											The most common favorite

											Firstborns across history have tended
to be bigger and healthier

											in part, because of the head start
they got on food
											in an area in which it could be scarce.
											Firstborns are also
vaccinated more reliably

follow-up visits to doctors

											And this pattern continues today.
											This IQ question is, sadly — I can

											One reason for this is that there are
a lot more people in your home
											than you think there are,
											or at least a lot more relationships.
											Every person in your house has
a discrete one-on-one relationship
											with every other person,
											and those pairings or dyads add up fast.
											In a family with two parents and two kids,
there are six dyads:
											Mom has a relationship with child A and B,
											Dad has a relationship with child A and B.
											There&#39;s the marital relationship,
											and there is the relationship
between the kids themselves.
											The formula for this
looks very chilly but it&#39;s real.
											K equals the number of people
in your household,
											and X equals the number of dyads.
											In a five-person family,
there are ten discrete dyads.
											The eight-person Brady Bunch —
never mind the sweetness here —
											there were 28 dyads in that family.
											The original Kennedy family with nine kids
had 55 different relationships.
											And Bobby Kennedy, who grew up
to have 11 children of his own,
											had a household with a whopping 91 dyads.
											This overpopulation of relationships
											makes fights unavoidable.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And far and away the biggest trigger
for all sibling fights is property.
											Studies have found that over 95 percent
of the fights among small children
											concern somebody touching, playing with,
											looking at the other person&#39;s stuff.

											This in its own way is healthy
if it&#39;s very noisy,
											and the reason is that small children
come into the world
											with absolutely no control.
											They are utterly helpless.
											The only way they have
of projecting their very limited power
											is through the objects
they can call their own.
											When somebody crosses
that very erasable line,
											they&#39;re going to go nuts,
and that&#39;s what happens.

											Another very common casus belli
among children is the idea of fairness,
											as any parent who hears 14 times a day,
&quot;But that&#39;s unfair!&quot;
											can tell you.
											In a way this is good, too, though.
											Kids are born with a very innate sense
of right and wrong,
											of a fair deal versus an unfair one,
											and this teaches them powerful lessons.
											Do you want to know how powerfully encoded
fairness is in the human genome?
											We process that phenomenon
											through the same lobe in our brain
that processes disgust,
											meaning we react to the idea
of somebody being cheated
											the same way we react to putrefied meat.

											All of these dramas played out day to day,

avoidance and conflict resolution,

caring, compromise,

											Brothers and sisters aren&#39;t
the sine qua non of a happy life;
											plenty of adult sibling
relationships are fatally broken
											and need to be abandoned
for the sanity of everybody involved.
											And only-children, throughout history,
have shown themselves
											to be creatively, brilliantly capable
											of getting their socialization
and comradeship skills
											through friends, through cousins,
through classmates.
											But having siblings and not
making the most of those bonds
											is, I believe, folly of the first order.
											If relationships are broken
and are fixable, fix them.
											If they work, make them even better.
											Failing to do so is a little like having
a thousand acres of fertile farmland
											and never planting it.
											Yes, you can always get your food
at the supermarket,
											but think what you&#39;re
allowing to lie fallow.
											Life is short, it&#39;s finite,
and it plays for keeps.
											Siblings may be among the richest harvests
of the time we have here.
