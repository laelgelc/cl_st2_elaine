											So the Awesome story:
											It begins about 40 years ago,
											when my mom and my dad came to Canada.
											My mom left Nairobi, Kenya.
											My dad left a small village outside of Amritsar, India.
											And they got here in the late 1960s.
											They settled in a shady suburb about an hour east of Toronto,
											and they settled into a new life.
											They saw their first dentist,
											they ate their first hamburger,
											and they had their first kids.
											My sister and I
											grew up here,
											and we had quiet, happy childhoods.
											We had close family,
											good friends, a quiet street.
											We grew up taking for granted
											a lot of the things that my parents couldn&#39;t take for granted
											when they grew up —
											things like power always on
											in our houses,
											things like schools across the street
											and hospitals down the road
											and popsicles in the backyard.
											We grew up, and we grew older.
											I went to high school.
											I graduated.
											I moved out of the house, I got a job,
											I found a girl, I settled down —
											and I realize it sounds like a bad sitcom or a Cat Stevens&#39; song —

											but life was pretty good.
											Life was pretty good.
											2006 was a great year.
											Under clear blue skies in July in the wine region of Ontario,
											I got married,
											surrounded by 150 family and friends.
											2007 was a great year.
											I graduated from school,
											and I went on a road trip with two of my closest friends.
											Here&#39;s a picture of me and my friend, Chris,
											on the coast of the Pacific Ocean.
											We actually saw seals out of our car window,
											and we pulled over to take a quick picture of them
											and then blocked them with our giant heads.

											2008 and 2009 were a little tougher.
											I know that they were tougher for a lot of people,
											not just me.
											First of all, the news was so heavy.
											It&#39;s still heavy now, and it was heavy before that,
											but when you flipped open a newspaper, when you turned on the TV,
											it was about ice caps melting,
											wars going on around the world,
											earthquakes, hurricanes
											and an economy that was wobbling on the brink of collapse,
											and then eventually did collapse,
											and so many of us losing our homes,
											or our jobs,
											or our retirements,
											or our livelihoods.
											2008, 2009 were heavy years for me for another reason, too.
											I was going through a lot of personal problems at the time.
											My marriage wasn&#39;t going well,
											and we just were growing further and further apart.
											One day my wife came home from work
											and summoned the courage, through a lot of tears,
											to have a very honest conversation.
											And she said, &quot;I don&#39;t love you anymore,&quot;
											and it was one of the most painful things I&#39;d ever heard
											and certainly the most heartbreaking thing I&#39;d ever heard,
											until only a month later,
											when I heard something even more heartbreaking.

											My friend Chris, who I just showed you a picture of,
											had been battling mental illness for some time.
											And for those of you
											whose lives have been touched by mental illness,
											you know how challenging it can be.
											I spoke to him on the phone at 10:30 p.m.
											on a Sunday night.
											We talked about the TV show we watched that evening.
											And Monday morning, I found out that he disappeared.
											Very sadly, he took his own life.
											And it was a really heavy time.

											And as these dark clouds were circling me,
											and I was finding it really, really difficult
											to think of anything good,
											I said to myself that I really needed a way
											to focus on the positive somehow.
											So I came home from work one night,
											and I logged onto the computer,
											and I started up a tiny website
											called 1000awesomethings.com.
											I was trying to remind myself
											of the simple, universal, little pleasures that we all love,
											but we just don&#39;t talk about enough —
											things like waiters and waitresses
											who bring you free refills without asking,
											being the first table to get called up
											to the dinner buffet at a wedding,
											wearing warm underwear from just out of the dryer,
											or when cashiers open up a new check-out lane at the grocery store
											and you get to be first in line —
											even if you were last at the other line, swoop right in there.

											And slowly over time,
											I started putting myself in a better mood.
											I mean, 50,000 blogs
											are started a day,
											and so my blog was just one of those 50,000.
											And nobody read it except for my mom.
											Although I should say that my traffic did skyrocket
											and go up by 100 percent
											when she forwarded it to my dad.
											(Laughter)
											And then I got excited
											when it started getting tens of hits,
											and then I started getting excited when it started getting dozens
											and then hundreds and then thousands
											and then millions.
											It started getting bigger and bigger and bigger.
											And then I got a phone call,
											and the voice at the other end of the line said,
											&quot;You&#39;ve just won the Best Blog In the World award.&quot;
											I was like, that sounds totally fake.
											(Laughter)
											(Applause)
											Which African country do you want me to wire all my money to?
											(Laughter)
											But it turns out, I jumped on a plane,
											and I ended up walking a red carpet
											between Sarah Silverman and Jimmy Fallon and Martha Stewart.
											And I went onstage to accept a Webby award for Best Blog.
											And the surprise
											and just the amazement of that
											was only overshadowed by my return to Toronto,
											when, in my inbox,
											10 literary agents were waiting for me
											to talk about putting this into a book.
											Flash-forward to the next year
											and &quot;The Book of Awesome&quot; has now been
											number one on the bestseller list for 20 straight weeks.

											But look, I said I wanted to do three things with you today.
											I said I wanted to tell you the Awesome story,
											I wanted to share with you the three As of Awesome,
											and I wanted to leave you with a closing thought.
											So let&#39;s talk about those three As.
											Over the last few years,
											I haven&#39;t had that much time to really think.
											But lately I have had the opportunity to take a step back
											and ask myself: &quot;What is it over the last few years
											that helped me grow my website,
											but also grow myself?&quot;
											And I&#39;ve summarized those things, for me personally,
											as three As.
											They are Attitude, Awareness
											and Authenticity.
											I&#39;d love to just talk about each one briefly.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So Attitude:
											Look, we&#39;re all going to get lumps,
											and we&#39;re all going to get bumps.
											None of us can predict the future, but we do know one thing about it
											and that&#39;s that it ain&#39;t gonna go according to plan.
											We will all have high highs
											and big days and proud moments
											of smiles on graduation stages,
											father-daughter dances at weddings
											and healthy babies screeching in the delivery room,
											but between those high highs,
											we may also have some lumps and some bumps too.
											It&#39;s sad, and it&#39;s not pleasant to talk about,
											but your husband might leave you,
											your girlfriend could cheat,
											your headaches might be more serious than you thought,
											or your dog could get hit by a car on the street.
											It&#39;s not a happy thought,
											but your kids could get mixed up in gangs
											or bad scenes.
											Your mom could get cancer,
											your dad could get mean.
											And there are times in life
											when you will be tossed in the well, too,
											with twists in your stomach and with holes in your heart,
											and when that bad news washes over you,
											and when that pain sponges and soaks in,
											I just really hope you feel
											like you&#39;ve always got two choices.
											One, you can swirl and twirl
											and gloom and doom forever,
											or two, you can grieve
											and then face the future
											with newly sober eyes.
											Having a great attitude is about choosing option number two,
											and choosing, no matter how difficult it is,
											no matter what pain hits you,
											choosing to move forward and move on
											and take baby steps into the future.

											The second &quot;A&quot; is Awareness.
											I love hanging out with three year-olds.
											I love the way that they see the world,
											because they&#39;re seeing the world for the first time.
											I love the way that they can stare at a bug crossing the sidewalk.
											I love the way that they&#39;ll stare slack-jawed
											at their first baseball game
											with wide eyes and a mitt on their hand,
											soaking in the crack of the bat and the crunch of the peanuts
											and the smell of the hotdogs.
											I love the way that they&#39;ll spend hours picking dandelions in the backyard
											and putting them into a nice centerpiece
											for Thanksgiving dinner.
											I love the way that they see the world,
											because they&#39;re seeing the world
											for the first time.
											Having a sense of awareness
											is just about embracing your inner three year-old.
											Because you all used to be three years old.
											That three-year-old boy is still part of you.
											That three-year-old girl is still part of you.
											They&#39;re in there.
											And being aware is just about remembering
											that you saw everything you&#39;ve seen
											for the first time once, too.
											So there was a time when it was your first time ever
											hitting a string of green lights on the way home from work.
											There was the first time you walked by the open door of a bakery
											and smelt the bakery air,
											or the first time you pulled a 20-dollar bill out of your old jacket pocket
											and said, &quot;Found money.&quot;

											The last &quot;A&quot; is Authenticity.
											And for this one, I want to tell you a quick story.
											Let&#39;s go all the way back to 1932
											when, on a peanut farm in Georgia,
											a little baby boy named Roosevelt Grier was born.
											Roosevelt Grier, or Rosey Grier, as people used to call him,
											grew up and grew into
											a 300-pound, six-foot-five linebacker in the NFL.
											He&#39;s number 76 in the picture.
											Here he is pictured with the &quot;fearsome foursome.&quot;
											These were four guys on the L.A. Rams in the 1960s
											you did not want to go up against.
											They were tough football players doing what they love,
											which was crushing skulls
											and separating shoulders on the football field.
											But Rosey Grier also had
											another passion.
											In his deeply authentic self,
											he also loved needlepoint. (Laughter)
											He loved knitting.
											He said that it calmed him down, it relaxed him,
											it took away his fear of flying and helped him meet chicks.
											That&#39;s what he said.
											I mean, he loved it so much that, after he retired from the NFL,
											he started joining clubs.
											And he even put out a book
											called &quot;Rosey Grier&#39;s Needlepoint for Men.&quot;
											(Laughter)
											(Applause)
											It&#39;s a great cover.
											If you notice, he&#39;s actually needlepointing his own face.

								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And so what I love about this story
											is that Rosey Grier
											is just such an authentic person,
											and that&#39;s what authenticity is all about.
											It&#39;s just about being you and being cool with that.
											And I think when you&#39;re authentic,
											you end up following your heart,
											and you put yourself in places
											and situations and in conversations
											that you love and that you enjoy.
											You meet people that you like talking to.
											You go places you&#39;ve dreamt about.
											And you end you end up following your heart
											and feeling very fulfilled.
											So those are the three A&#39;s.

											For the closing thought, I want to take you all the way back
											to my parents coming to Canada.
											I don&#39;t know what it would feel like
											coming to a new country when you&#39;re in your mid-20s.
											I don&#39;t know, because I never did it,
											but I would imagine that it would take a great attitude.
											I would imagine that you&#39;d have to be pretty aware of your surroundings
											and appreciating the small wonders
											that you&#39;re starting to see in your new world.
											And I think you&#39;d have to be really authentic,
											you&#39;d have to be really true to yourself
											in order to get through what you&#39;re being exposed to.

											When I was growing up, my dad used to love telling the story
											of his first day in Canada.
											And it&#39;s a great story, because what happened was
											he got off the plane at the Toronto airport,
											and he was welcomed by a non-profit group,
											which I&#39;m sure someone in this room runs.
											(Laughter)
											And this non-profit group had a big welcoming lunch
											for all the new immigrants to Canada.
											And my dad says he got off the plane and he went to this lunch
											and there was this huge spread.
											There was bread, there was those little, mini dill pickles,
											there was olives, those little white onions.
											There was rolled up turkey cold cuts,
											rolled up ham cold cuts, rolled up roast beef cold cuts
											and little cubes of cheese.
											There was tuna salad sandwiches and egg salad sandwiches
											and salmon salad sandwiches.
											There was lasagna, there was casseroles,
											there was brownies, there was butter tarts,

											When I was five years old,

											at the little stickers that are on the fruits and vegetables.
											He would say, &quot;Look, can you believe they have a mango here from Mexico?
											They&#39;ve got an apple here from South Africa.
											Can you believe they&#39;ve got a date from Morocco?&quot;

											And we&#39;d actually take an atlas off the shelf,

											We&#39;ve got airplanes, highway lanes,
											interior design and horoscope signs.
											We&#39;ve got fashion magazines, house party scenes.
											You can watch a horror movie with monsters.
											You can go to a concert and hear guitars jamming.
											We&#39;ve got books, buffets and radio waves,
											wedding brides and rollercoaster rides.
											You can sleep in clean sheets.
											You can go to the movies and get good seats.
											You can smell bakery air, walk around with rain hair,
											pop bubble wrap or take an illegal nap.

											We&#39;ve got all that,
											but we&#39;ve only got 100 years to enjoy it.
											And that&#39;s the sad part.
											The cashiers at your grocery store,
											the foreman at your plant,
											the guy tailgating you home on the highway,
											the telemarketer calling you during dinner,
											every teacher you&#39;ve ever had,
											everyone that&#39;s ever woken up beside you,
											every politician in every country,
											every actor in every movie,
											every single person in your family, everyone you love,
											everyone in this room and you
											will be dead in a hundred years.
											Life is so great that we only get such a short time
											to experience and enjoy
											all those tiny little moments that make it so sweet.
											And that moment is right now,
											and those moments are counting down,
											and those moments are always, always, always fleeting.

											You will never be as young as you are right now.
											And that&#39;s why I believe that if you live your life
											with a great attitude,
											choosing to move forward and move on
											whenever life deals you a blow,
											living with a sense of awareness of the world around you,
											embracing your inner three year-old
											and seeing the tiny joys that make life so sweet
											and being authentic to yourself,
											being you and being cool with that,
											letting your heart lead you and putting yourself in experiences that satisfy you,
											then I think you&#39;ll live a life
											that is rich and is satisfying,
											and I think you&#39;ll live a life that is truly awesome.

He channeled his energies into his blog 1000 Awesome Things, which counted down one small pleasure -- like snow days, bakery air or finding money in your coat pocket -- every single day for 1000 straight days. While writing his blog, Neil was working as Director of Leadership Development inside Walmart, the world&#39;s largest company.

While writing his blog, Neil was working as Director of Leadership Development inside Walmart, the world&#39;s largest company.
