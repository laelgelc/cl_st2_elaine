In this fun and accessible talk about how science happens, Beacham takes us on a journey through extra-spatial dimensions in search of undiscovered fundamental particles (and an explanation for the mysteries of gravity) and details the drive to keep exploring." itemprop='description'>

											There is something about physics
											that has been really bothering me
since I was a little kid.
											And it&#39;s related to a question
											that scientists have been asking
for almost 100 years,
											with no answer.
											How do the smallest things in nature,
											the particles of the quantum world,
											match up with the largest
things in nature —
											planets and stars and galaxies
held together by gravity?

											As a kid, I would puzzle
over questions just like this.
											I would fiddle around
with microscopes and electromagnets,
											and I would read
about the forces of the small
											and about quantum mechanics
											and I would marvel at how well
that description matched up
											to our observation.
											Then I would look at the stars,
											and I would read about how well
we understand gravity,
											and I would think surely,
there must be some elegant way
											that these two systems match up.
											But there&#39;s not.
											And the books would say,
											yeah, we understand a lot
about these two realms separately,
											but when we try to link
them mathematically,
											everything breaks.

											this was a supremely unsatisfying answer.

											So, I&#39;m still a skeptical little kid.
											Flash-forward now
to December of 2015,
											when I found myself smack in the middle
											of the physics world
being flipped on its head.
											It all started when we at CERN
saw something intriguing in our data:
											a hint of a new particle,
											an inkling of a possibly extraordinary
answer to this question.

									<p>
											So I&#39;m still a skeptical
little kid, I think,
											but I&#39;m also now a particle hunter.
											I am a physicist at CERN&#39;s
Large Hadron Collider,
											the largest science
experiment ever mounted.
											It&#39;s a 27-kilometer tunnel
on the border of France and Switzerland
											buried 100 meters underground.
											And in this tunnel,
											we use superconducting magnets
colder than outer space
											to accelerate protons
to almost the speed of light
											and slam them into each other
millions of times per second,
											collecting the debris of these collisions
											to search for new, undiscovered
fundamental particles.
											Its design and construction
took decades of work
											by thousands of physicists
from around the globe,
											and in the summer of 2015,
											we had been working tirelessly
to switch on the LHC
											at the highest energy that humans
have ever used in a collider experiment.

									<p>
											Now, higher energy is important
											because for particles,
there is an equivalence
											between energy and particle mass,
											and mass is just a number
put there by nature.
											To discover new particles,
											we need to reach these bigger numbers.
											And to do that, we have to build
a bigger, higher energy collider,
											and the biggest, highest
energy collider in the world
											is the Large Hadron Collider.
											And then, we collide protons
quadrillions of times,
											and we collect this data very slowly,
over months and months.
											And then new particles might show up
in our data as bumps —
											slight deviations from what you expect,
											little clusters of data points
that make a smooth line not so smooth.
											For example, this bump,
											after months of data-taking in 2012,
											led to the discovery
of the Higgs particle —
											the Higgs boson —
											and to a Nobel Prize
for the confirmation of its existence.

											This jump up in energy in 2015
											represented the best chance
that we as a species had ever had
											of discovering new particles —
											new answers to these
long-standing questions,
											because it was almost
twice as much energy as we used
											when we discovered the Higgs boson.
											Many of my colleagues had been working
their entire careers for this moment,
											and frankly, to little curious me,
											this was the moment
I&#39;d been waiting for my entire life.
											So 2015 was go time.

											So June 2015,
											the LHC is switched back on.
											My colleagues and I held our breath
and bit our fingernails,
											and then finally we saw
the first proton collisions

											Applause, champagne, celebration.
											This was a milestone for science,
											and we had no idea what we would find
in this brand-new data.
											And then a few weeks later,
we found a bump.
											It wasn&#39;t a very big bump,
											but it was big enough to make
you raise your eyebrow.
											But on a scale of one to 10
for eyebrow raises,
											if 10 indicates that you&#39;ve
discovered a new particle,

											Humanity has just begun its exploration
at the LHC at this big high energy,

											But what if, even after 10 or 20 years,
we still find no new particles?
											We build a bigger machine.

											Perhaps we need to rethink things.
											Maybe we need more resources,
technology, expertise
											than what we currently have.
											We already use artificial intelligence

a particle physics experiment

											We will be forced to think
in completely new ways.
											We&#39;ll have to go back to our assumptions,
											and determine if there was
a flaw somewhere.
											And we&#39;ll need to encourage more people
to join us in studying science
											since we need fresh eyes
on these century-old problems.
											I don&#39;t have the answers,
and I&#39;m still searching for them.
											But someone — maybe
she&#39;s in school right now,
											maybe she&#39;s not even born yet —
											could eventually guide us to see physics
in a completely new way,
											and to point out that perhaps
we&#39;re just asking the wrong questions.
											Which would not be the end of physics,

He has also worked with the APEX collaboration, a groundbreaking search for dark photons using existing particle physics facilities designed for very different purposes.</p><p>Beacham completed his PhD at New York University in 2014 and is currently a post-doctoral researcher with the ATLAS experiment group of the Ohio State University.

But to really understand and appreciate it, you need to dive into the mathematics behind it, that of gauge groups and quantum field theory.  This can be intimidating to many non-specialists. That’s why Bruce Schumm’s book is so good, since it presents the math of the Standard Model without the math, describing the concepts behind the mathematical structures -- and how they map into the physical world -- without overwhelming the reader with equations.  An unparalleled book for getting a deeper sense of what particle physics is all about without getting a PhD (although I also suggest you get that PhD).","note":"Bruce Schumm\r\nJohns Hopkins University Press, 2004","link_url":"https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Down-Things-Breathtaking-Particle/dp/080187971X/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0520271440&linkCode=as2&tag=teco06-20","position":null,"is_pdf":false,"eyebrow":null}]},{"title":"Videos","description":"","rec_items":[{"label":"WATCH","headline":"\"The Pleasure of Finding Things Out\" with Richard Feynman","blurb":"Essential viewing for anyone who wants to understand why physicists do what we do: because we’re insatiably curious.

discovered the Higgs boson in 2012, James Beacham&nbsp;is on the hunt for evidence of new particles -- dark photons, gravitons, dark matter and exotic Higgs bosons among them.</p><p>Previously, Beacham&nbsp;was part of a small team of researchers who, in 2009, searched for the Higgs boson in an unlikely place: data taken by the ALEPH experiment at CERN&#39;s Large Electron-Positron collider, nine years after it had stopped running. He has also worked with the APEX collaboration, a groundbreaking search for dark photons using existing particle physics facilities designed for very different purposes.</p><p>Beacham completed his PhD at New York University in 2014 and is currently a post-doctoral researcher with the ATLAS experiment group of the Ohio State University. He has been a guest on NPR&#39;s &quot;Science Friday,&quot; participated in documentaries on the BBC and the Discovery Channel and talked particle physics with the <em>New York Times</em> and <em>WIRED</em>.</p><p>In addition to his ongoing research, Beacham is dedicated to making particle physics accessible to all. He has communicated science to the public with <em>Symmetry</em> Magazine, US/LHC, the Science Museum in London, the Institute of Physics, the World Science Fair and on the Web.</p><p>In 2015, Beacham organized&nbsp;<a href=\"http://exnoisecern.ch/\" target=\"_blank\">Ex/Noise/CERN</a>, a project colliding particle physics with experimental music to celebrate the LHC&rsquo;s switch on to 13 trillion electron volts.</p>"}],"speaker_name":"James Beacham","tags":["collaboration","dark matter","discovery","future","data","innovation","motivation","engineering","nature","physics","history","science","Nobel Prize","universe","TEDx","exploration","quantum physics"],"title":"How we explore unanswered questions in physics","video_type":{"id":"2","name":"TEDx Talk"},"viewed_count":1545239}]}})</script></div>
