<title>Sheryl Sandberg: So we leaned in ... now what? | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Sheryl Sandberg admits she was terrified to step onto the TED stage in 2010 -- because she was going to talk, for the first time, about the lonely experience of being a woman in the top tiers of business. Millions of views (and a best-selling book) later, the Facebook COO talks with the woman who pushed her to give that first talk, Pat Mitchell. Sandberg opens up about the reaction to her idea, and explores the ways that women still struggle with success." />

<meta content='Sheryl Sandberg admits she was terrified to step onto the TED stage in 2010 — because she was going to talk, for the first time, about the lonely experience of being a woman in the top tiers of business. Millions of views (and a best-selling book) later, the Facebook COO talks with the woman who pushed her to give that first talk, Pat Mitchell. Sandberg opens up about the reaction to her idea, and explores the ways that women still struggle with success.' itemprop='description'>

											SS: So I was really scared to get on 
this stage and talk about women,
											because I grew up in the business 
world, as I think so many of us did.
											You never talk about being a woman, because 
someone might notice that you&#39;re a woman, right?
											They might notice. Or worse, if you say &quot;woman,&quot; 
people on the other end of the table
											think you&#39;re asking for special 
treatment, or complaining.
											Or worse, about to sue them. 
And so I went through — (Laughter)
											Right? I went through my entire business career,
											and never spoke about being a woman, 
never spoke about it publicly.
											But I also had noticed that it wasn&#39;t working.

											I came out of college over 
20 years ago, and I thought
											that all of my peers were men and women, 
all the people above me were all men,
											but that would change,
											because your generation had done such 
an amazing job fighting for equality,
											equality was now ours for the taking. And it wasn&#39;t.
											Because year after year, I was one of fewer and fewer,
											and now, often the only woman in a room.
											And I talked to a bunch of people about,
											should I give a speech at TEDWomen 
about women, and they said, oh no, no.
											It will end your business career. You 
cannot be a serious business executive
											and speak about being a woman. 
You&#39;ll never be taken seriously again.

											But fortunately, there were the few, the proud — like you — who told me I should give the speech,

Mark Zuckerberg might —
											the founder of Facebook and my boss —
											asks all of us, which is, what 
would I do if I wasn&#39;t afraid?
											And the answer to what would I do if I wasn&#39;t 
afraid is I would get on the TED stage,

And I did, and survived. (Applause)

											SS: Well, it&#39;s an important part of the 
journey. So I had — TEDWomen —
											the original one was in D.C. — so I live here, 
so I had gotten on a plane the day before,
											and my daughter was three, she was 
clinging to my leg: &quot;Mommy, don&#39;t go.&quot;
											And Pat&#39;s a friend, and so, not related 
to the speech I was planning on giving,
											which was chock full of facts and 
figures, and nothing personal,
											I told Pat the story. I said, well, 
I&#39;m having a hard day.
											Yesterday my daughter was clinging 
to my leg, and &quot;Don&#39;t go.&quot;
									</p>
								</div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And you looked at me and said, 
you have to tell that story.
											I said, on the TED stage? Are you kidding?
											I&#39;m going to get on a stage and admit 
my daughter was clinging to my leg?
											And you said yes, because if you want to talk 
about getting more women into leadership roles,
											you have to be honest about how hard it is.
											And I did. And I think that&#39;s a really 
important part of the journey.

											The same thing happened when I wrote my book. 
I started writing the book. I wrote a first chapter,
											I thought it was fabulous. It was 
chock-full of data and figures,
											I had three pages on matrilineal Maasai 
tribes, and their sociological patterns.
											My husband read it and he was like, this 
is like eating your Wheaties. (Laughter)
											No one — and I apologize to Wheaties if there&#39;s 
someone — no one, no one will read this book.
											And I realized through the process that I 
had to be more honest and more open,
											and I had to tell my stories. My stories of still 
not feeling as self-confident as I should,
											in many situations. My first and 
failed marriage. Crying at work.
											Felling like I didn&#39;t belong there, 
feeling guilty to this day.
											And part of my journey, starting on this stage, 
going to &quot;Lean In,&quot; going to the foundation,
											is all about being more open and 
honest about those challenges,
											so that other women can be more open and honest,
											and all of us can work together towards real equality.

									<p>
											PM: I think that one of the most 
striking parts about the book,
											and in my opinion, one of the reasons it&#39;s hit such 
a nerve and is resonating around the world,
											is that you are personal in the book, 
and that you do make it clear that,
											while you&#39;ve observed some things that are 
very important for other women to know,
											that you&#39;ve had the same challenges 
that many others of us have,
											as you faced the hurdles and the barriers and 
possibly the people who don&#39;t believe the same.
											So talk about that process: deciding 
you&#39;d go public with the private part,
											and then you would also put yourself in 
the position of something of an expert
											on how to resolve those challenges.

											SS: After I did the TED Talk, what happened was —
											you know, I never really expected to write 
a book, I&#39;m not an author, I&#39;m not a writer,
											and it was viewed a lot, and it really 
started impacting people&#39;s lives.
											I got this great —- one of the first 
letters I got was from a woman
											who said that she was offered a really big 
promotion at work, and she turned it down,
											and she told her best friend she turned 
it down, and her best friend said,
											you really need to watch this TED Talk.
											And so she watched this TED Talk, and she 
went back the next day, she took the job,
											she went home, and she handed her 
husband the grocery list. (Laughter)
											And she said, I can do this.

											And what really mattered to me — it wasn&#39;t 
only women in the corporate world,
											even though I did hear from a lot of 
them, and it did impact a lot of them,
											it was also people of all different circumstances.
											There was a doctor I met who was an 
attending physician at Johns Hopkins,
											and he said that until he saw my TED 
Talk, it never really occurred to him
											that even though half the students in 
his med school classes were women,
											they weren&#39;t speaking as much as 
the men as he did his rounds.
											So he started paying attention, and as he waited for 
raised hands, he realized the men&#39;s hands were up.
											So he started encouraging the 
women to raise their hands more,
											and it still didn&#39;t work.
											So he told everyone, no more 
hand raising, I&#39;m cold-calling.
											So he could call evenly on men and women. 
And what he proved to himself was that
											the women knew the answers just as well or better,
											and he was able to go back 
to them and tell them that.
											And then there was the woman, stay-at-home 
mom, lives in a really difficult neighborhood,
											with not a great school, she said that TED 
Talk — she&#39;s never had a corporate job,
											but that TED Talk inspired her to go to her school 
and fight for a better teacher for her child.
											And I guess it was part of was finding my own voice.
											And I realized that other women and 
men could find their voice through it,
											which is why I went from the talk to the book.

voice, which is clear and strong in the book,

in terms of putting yourself in a —
											you became a sort of expert in how you lean in.

become like in your life?

											To launch not just a book, not just 
a best-selling, best-viewed talk,

literally describe their actions at work as,

I&#39;m happy, and it&#39;s the very beginning.
											So I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m an expert, or if anyone is 
an expert. I certainly have done a lot of research.
											I have read every study, I have 
pored over the materials,
											and the lessons are very clear. 
Because here&#39;s what we know:
											What we know is that stereotypes are holding women 
back from leadership roles all over the world.
											It&#39;s so striking. &quot;Lean In&quot; is very global, 
I&#39;ve been all over the world,
											talking about it, and — cultures are so different.
											Even within our own country, to Japan, 
to Korea, to China, to Asia, Europe,
											they&#39;re so different. Except for one thing: gender.
											All over the world, no matter what our cultures are,

											SS: And these are people who 
are meeting every single month.
											I met one of them, I was in Beijing.
											A group of women, they&#39;re all about 29 or 30, 
they started the first Lean In circle in Beijing,
											several of them grew up in very poor, rural China.
											These women are 29, they are told by 
their society that they are &quot;left over,&quot;
											because they are not yet married,
											and the process of coming together 
once a month at a meeting
											is helping them define who they are for themselves.
											What they want in their careers. The 
kind of partners they want, if at all.
											I looked at them, we went around 
and introduced ourselves,
											and they all said their names 
and where they&#39;re from,
											and I said, I&#39;m Sheryl Sandberg, 
and this was my dream.
											And I kind of just started crying.
											Right, which, I admit, I do. Right? 
I&#39;ve talked about it before.
											But the fact that a woman so far away out in 
the world, who grew up in a rural village,
											who&#39;s being told to marry someone 
she doesn&#39;t want to marry,
											can now go meet once a month with 
a group of people and refuse that,
											and find life on her own terms.
											That&#39;s the kind of change we have to hope for.

											PM: Have you been surprised by 
the global nature of the message?

											Because I think when the book first 
came out, many people thought,
											well, this is a really important handbook 
for young women on their way up.
											They need to look at this, anticipate 
the barriers, and recognize them,
											put them out in the open, have the dialogue about it,
											but that it&#39;s really for women who are that. 
Doing that. Pursuing the corporate world.
											And yet the book is being read, as you 
say, in rural and developing countries.
											What part of that has surprised you, and 
perhaps led to a new perspective on your part?

											SS: The book is about self-confidence, 
and about equality.
											And it turns out, everywhere in the world, 
women need more self-confidence,
											because the world tells us we&#39;re not equal to men.
											Everywhere in the world, we live in 
a world where the men get &quot;and,&quot;
											and women get &quot;or.&quot;
											I&#39;ve never met a man who&#39;s been 
asked how he does it all. (Laughter)

											Again, I&#39;m going to turn to the men in the audience:

been asked, how do you do it all?
											(Laughter)
											Men only.
											Women, women. Please raise your hand 
if you&#39;ve been asked how you do it all?
											We assume men can do it all, 
slash — have jobs and children.
											We assume women can&#39;t, and that&#39;s ridiculous,
											because the great majority of women everywhere 
in the world, including the United States,
											work full time and have children.

											And I think people don&#39;t fully understand 
how broad the message is.
											There is a circle that&#39;s been started 
for rescued sex workers in Miami.
											They&#39;re using &quot;Lean In&quot; to help 
people make the transition
											back to what would be a fair life, really rescuing 
them from their pimps, and using it.
											There are dress-for-success groups 
in Texas which are using the book,
											for women who have never been to college.
											And we know there are groups 
all the way to Ethiopia.
											And so these messages of equality — of how women 
are told they can&#39;t have what men can have —
											how we assume that leadership is for men, 
how we assume that voice is for men,
											these affect all of us, and I 
think they are very universal.
											And it&#39;s part of what TEDWomen does.
											It unites all of us in a cause we have to believe in,
											which is more women, more voice, more equality.

											SS: I think I would say — I tried to say this strongly,
											but I think I can say it more strongly —
											I want to say that the status quo is not enough.
											That it&#39;s not good enough, that it&#39;s 
not changing quickly enough.
											Since I gave my TED Talk and published my book, 
another year of data came out from the U.S. Census.
											And you know what we found?
											No movement in the wage gap 
for women in the United States.
											Seventy-seven cents to the dollar.
											If you are a black woman, 64 cents.
											If you are a Latina, we&#39;re at 54 cents.
											Do you know when the last 
time those numbers went up?
											2002.
											We are stagnating, we are 
stagnating in so many ways.
											And I think we are not really being honest about that,
											for so many reasons. It&#39;s so 
hard to talk about gender.
											We shy away from the word &quot;feminist,&quot; 
a word I really think we need to embrace.
											We have to get rid of the 
word bossy and bring back —
											(Applause)
											I think I would say in a louder voice, 
we need to get rid of the word &quot;bossy&quot;
											and bring back the word &quot;feminist,&quot; 
because we need it.

It&rsquo;s a massive job, but one well suited to Sandberg, who not only built and managed Google&rsquo;s successful online sales and operations program but also served as an economist for the World Bank and Chief of Staff at the US Treasury Department.

After her TED Talk took off, Sandberg wrote the book&nbsp;<a href=\"http://geni.us/leanin\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Lean In</em></a>, which has spent nearly a year on the <em>New York Times</em> Bestseller list.

Today she manages Facebook&rsquo;s sales, marketing, business development, human resources, public policy and communications. It&rsquo;s a massive job, but one well suited to Sandberg, who not only built and managed Google&rsquo;s successful online sales and operations program but also served as an economist for the World Bank and Chief of Staff at the US Treasury Department. Sandberg&rsquo;s experience navigating the complex and socially sensitive world of international economics has proven useful as she and Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg work to strike a balance between helping Facebook users control privacy while ﬁnding ways to monetize its most valuable asset: data.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">At TEDWomen in 2010 Sandberg made the bold decision to talk about the experience of being one of very few women at the C-level of business. She noted that many women, in anticipating having a family, &quot;lean back&quot; from leading at work. After her TED Talk took off, Sandberg wrote the book&nbsp;<a href=\"http://geni.us/leanin\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Lean In</em></a>, which has spent nearly a year on the <em>New York Times</em> Bestseller list. Sandberg plans to release a version of the book for graduates.</p>"}],"speaker_name":"Sheryl Sandberg","tags":["feminism","leadership","women","women in business","work","gender equality"],"title":"So we leaned in ... now what?","video_type":{"id":"1","name":"TED Stage Talk"},"viewed_count":2642482}]}})</script></div>
