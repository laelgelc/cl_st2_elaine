who had been living on the street

in New York City,

											The next three nights,
she slept out by the dumpster

											With the aid of her case manager,

											Homelessness is a continuing
challenge for many cities
											throughout our country.
											Our homeless population falls
into three major categories:
											those that are temporarily homeless,
											about 75 percent;
											those that are episodically homeless,
											about 10 percent;
											and those that are chronically homeless,
											about 15 percent.
											Chronic homelessness is defined
as an unaccompanied adult
											who has been continuously
homeless for a year or more
											or more than four times
homeless in three years
											that totals 365 days.
											This small 15 percent
of the homeless population
											can consume 50 to 60 percent
of the homeless resources
											available in a community.
											In addition, they can cost the community
											20,000 to 45,000 dollars a year per person
											in emergency services costs,
											such as EMT runs,
											emergency room visits,
as many of you will be aware,
											addictions, interactions with the police,
											jail time.
											Simply put, this small
population costs a lot.

											Based on this reality, the US government
began an initiative in 2003
											inviting states and cities and counties
											to develop a plan to end
chronic homelessness
											in a 10-year period.
											The state of Utah accepted
this invitation,
											and I was asked to lead this effort.
											In 2005, we approved a 10-year plan,
											and 10 years later, in 2015,
											we reported a reduction
in our chronic homeless population
											of 91 percent statewide.

											That&#39;s amazing.
											When I began this process,
and we began this process,
											I realized that I had a limited
understanding of homelessness
											and the factors that impacted it,
											and that I needed a fairly major change
in my belief, in my thinking,
											because I had been raised
with the theory of rugged individualism
											and &quot;pull yourself up by the bootstraps.&quot;
											That philosophy came from being raised
on our family&#39;s cattle ranch
											in a small town
in the western desert of Utah.
											On the ranch, you learned
that nothing takes priority
											over caring for the cattle,
											something always needs fixing
											and most importantly,
											hard work makes the world right.
											It was through that lens
that I would see homeless people.
											When I was a teenager, our family
would go into Salt Lake City,
											and I would see these homeless people —
&quot;hobos&quot; we called them then —
											sitting around on the street,
											and I would think,
											&quot;You lazy bums, get a job.
Pull yourself up by the bootstraps.&quot;

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											After high school, I left the ranch,
											graduated from college,
											went to work for Ford Motor Company
for several years,
											then got a job at the Church
of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints
											and moved back to Salt Lake City.
											During that employment,
I had the opportunity to be loaned out
											to the state&#39;s largest homeless shelter
											to assist them in developing and improving
											their financial
and management capabilities.

											While there, I became aware
of a new approach
											to dealing with homeless individuals
											and drug addicts.
											It was called the harm reduction model,
											and it consisted of passing out
clean needles and condoms.
											And I thought, &quot;Now that
is one stupid idea.&quot;
											(Laughter)
											&quot;That&#39;s just going to encourage them
to continue that behavior.
											Just tell them to stop.&quot;
											Several years later, I read
some of the early 10-year plans
											to end chronic homelessness
											promoted by the federal government.
											As I read through those plans,
and I thought,
											&quot;Pfft! This is unrealistic.
											You can&#39;t end homelessness.
											There&#39;s too many personal choices
and factors beyond our control.&quot;

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											My perspective changed, however,
											when I attended a conference in 2003,
											where I learned the reason
behind the 10-year plan.
											First was this small population
of the homeless group
											that was 15 percent
and were very expensive.
											That made sense
											for a conservative state like Utah.

									<p>
											The second insight was learning
about this Housing First,
											or low-barrier housing.
											There had been an agency in New York City
											that had been inviting
mentally ill homeless individuals
											to move directly
from the street into housing.
											And they were also allowed to continue
to use drugs and to drink,
											just like we can in our homes.
											They were, in addition, offered
services — not required to use them —
											by on-site case managers
											to assist them to adjust
to their new living arrangements
											and to stabilize their lives.
											They were using the harm reduction model.
											And despite my initial low expectations
about hearing about this model,
											they were having
an astonishing success rate:
											85 percent were still housed
after 12 months.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											The third insight
											was the importance of developing
a trusting relationship.
											Because of the abuse
these individuals have had
											throughout most of their lives,
											they hardly trust anybody,
											and the clean needles and condoms
and low-barrier housing
											was a means to begin to develop
a relationship of trust.
											Vital.

									<p>
											So as I flew home from this conference,
											sitting in the plane
looking out the window,
											I realized that my understanding
and perspective about homelessness
											was shifting.
											And as I stared out that window,
											this very strong feeling
and thought came to me
											that if there&#39;s any state in the union
											that could end chronic homelessness,
											it was the state of Utah,
											because there&#39;s an underlying feeling
											and desire and willingness
to collaborate to serve our neighbors,
											including those who are homeless.
											A new vision was becoming clear to me
how this could be done.

								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now, those of us that attended
the conference said,
											&quot;Yeah, these models will work in Utah.&quot;
											But when we got back home,
there were many who said,
											&quot;Nah, those aren&#39;t going to work.
They won&#39;t succeed here.&quot;
											But there was, however,
an affordable housing organization
											who was willing to build
our first 100 units.
											But they had concerns about having
100 chronically homeless people
											in one location.
											To address that concern,
we decided to create a pilot
											to test that idea while we built
the first 100 units.
											We would use existing units
scattered throughout Salt Lake City.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Then we debated:
											Should we select fairly
high-functioning homeless persons
											or the most challenging
ones we could find?
											And this is where my background
on the ranch came into play.
											Back then, my mother cooked our meals
											and heated the water for our weekly bath
											on a wood-burning and coal-burning stove.
											And after chopping wood
for that stove all those years,
											I&#39;d learned to chop
the big end of the log first,
											when I had the most energy.
											We decided to use the &quot;big end
of the log first&quot; approach
											and selected 17 of the most challenging,
											difficult, chronically homeless
people we could find,
											because we knew we would learn
the most from them.
											Twenty-two months later,
											all 17 were still housed,
											including Keta,
											who today, 11 years later,
											is sleeping in her own bed
											and is sober.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											At the end of this pilot,
one of the young case managers said,
											&quot;We used to debate
up at our university classes
											which theory of case management
was the most effective.
											Now our theory of case management is:
											anything necessary to keep them housed.&quot;
											We became believers,
											and built hundreds of units
over those next 10 years,
											leading to the reduction of our statewide
chronic homeless population
											of 91 percent.

									<p>
											Now, who are homeless people?
											Many people just want them
to go away, to disappear,
											not disrupt our lives.
											Through this 10-year, 11-year process,
I gained many insights
											of why people become homeless.
											One of those insights
came to me a few years ago
											when I was visiting
with our medical outreach team.
											These are our frontline workers
											that go out and visit
the street homeless and the prostitutes
											to check on their medical health.
											One of the team members mentioned
											that eight of the prostitutes
had given birth to 31 children
											that had become wards of the state.
											They also shared that some of the pimps
were their husbands,
											and worse yet,
											their parents.
											These prostitutes,
											in their late teens, 20s, early 30s,
											were expected to earn
enough money a day to support
											a hundred-dollar-a-day heroin addiction,
											their living expenses
											and their pimp.
											And with unprotected sex,
they were paid more,
											and predictably,
this would lead to a pregnancy.
											Children born under these circumstances
many times end up becoming homeless.
											And it&#39;s not helpful to look at
those born under those circumstances,
											or a parent that makes their child
a drug addict at age seven,
											or a generation of babies
born through drug addiction,
											and not feel some despair.
											For me, I believe
every person is of value,
											no matter who you are.
											And it&#39;s not helpful to look
at somebody with this start in life
											and blame them for where they are.

											No one grows up saying,

											And that&#39;s the beauty of the harm

											The pilot we did with our 17
taught us many lessons.
											When people have been living
on the street for many years,
											moving back into housing
											requires lots of things to learn.
											And Donald
											taught us some
of these transition lessons.
											His case manager asked him
why he had not turned up the heat
											in his cold apartment.
											Donald said, &quot;How do you do that?&quot;
											He was shown how to use a thermostat.
											The case manager also observed
											that he was heating the beans
in the can on the stove,
											like he had done over
the campfires for many years.
											He was shown how to use pots and pans.
											We also learned that he had a sister
that he had not seen in 25 years,
											who thought he was dead.
											She was happy to learn otherwise,
											and they were soon reconnected.
											Hundreds of people like Keta
and Donald are now housed
											and reconnecting with their families.
											Also, many of our
communities are incurring
											fewer emergency services costs.

His goal: to functionally eliminate the state&#39;s chronic homelessness problem within 10 years. Through Utah&#39;s Housing First program, Pendleton prioritized providing the homeless with short-term assistance to find permanent housing quickly, and without conditions. With access to permanent, stable housing, individuals were better equipped to sustainably improve their wellbeing. The Housing First approach succeeded in reducing the number of homeless from 1,932 to 168 by 2016. Pendleton retired from state employment in June 2015&nbsp;and has since been consulting with other states about different approaches to eliminate chronic homelessness.</p>"}],"speaker_name":"Lloyd Pendleton","tags":["community","cities","humanity","innovation","social change","society","poverty","TEDMED","homelessness"],"title":"The Housing First approach to homelessness","video_type":{"id":"1","name":"TED Stage Talk"},"viewed_count":1037568}]}})</script></div>
