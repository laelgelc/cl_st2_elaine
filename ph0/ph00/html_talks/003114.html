											This is Martha Payne. Martha&#39;s a 9-year-old Scot
											who lives in the Council of Argyll and Bute.
											A couple months ago, Payne started a food blog
											called NeverSeconds, and she would take her camera
											with her every day to school to document
											her school lunches.
											Can you spot the vegetable? (Laughter)
											And, as sometimes happens,
											this blog acquired first dozens of readers,
											and then hundreds of readers,
											and then thousands of readers, as people tuned in
											to watch her rate her school lunches,
											including on my favorite category,
											&quot;Pieces of hair found in food.&quot; (Laughter)

											Now, this isn&#39;t just a contemporaneous question.
											This is something we&#39;ve faced several times
											over the last few centuries.
											When the telegraph came along, it was clear
											that it was going to globalize the news industry.
											What would this lead to?
											Well, obviously, it would lead to world peace.
											The television, a medium that allowed us not just to hear
											but see, literally see, what was going on
											elsewhere in the world, what would this lead to?
											World peace. (Laughter)
											The telephone?
											You guessed it: world peace.
											Sorry for the spoiler alert, but no world peace. Not yet.
											Even the printing press, even the printing press
											was assumed to be a tool that was going to enforce
											Catholic intellectual hegemony across Europe.
											Instead, what we got was Martin Luther&#39;s 95 Theses,
											the Protestant Reformation, and, you know,
											the Thirty Years&#39; War. All right,
											so what all of these predictions of world peace got right
											is that when a lot of new ideas suddenly
											come into circulation, it changes society.
											What they got exactly wrong was what happens next.

											The more ideas there are in circulation,
											the more ideas there are for any individual to disagree with.
											More media always means more arguing.
											That&#39;s what happens when the media&#39;s space expands.
											And yet, when we look back on the printing press

											We are a pro-printing press society.

											And the answer, I think, can be found in things like this.
											This is the cover of &quot;Philosophical Transactions,&quot;
											the first scientific journal ever published in English
											in the middle of the 1600s,
											and it was created by a group of people who had been
											calling themselves &quot;The Invisible College,&quot;
											a group of natural philosophers who only later
											would call themselves scientists,
											and they wanted to improve the way
											natural philosophers argued with each other,
											and they needed to do two things for this.
											They needed openness. They needed to create a norm
											which said, when you do an experiment,
											you have to publish not just your claims,
											but how you did the experiment.
											If you don&#39;t tell us how you did it, we won&#39;t trust you.
											But the other thing they needed was speed.
											They had to quickly synchronize what
											other natural philosophers knew. Otherwise,
											you couldn&#39;t get the right kind of argument going.
											The printing press was clearly the right medium for this,
											but the book was the wrong tool. It was too slow.
											And so they invented the scientific journal
											as a way of synchronizing the argument
											across the community of natural scientists.
											The scientific revolution wasn&#39;t created by the printing press.
											It was created by scientists,
											but it couldn&#39;t have been created if they didn&#39;t have
											a printing press as a tool.

											So what about us? What about our generation,
											and our media revolution, the Internet?
											Well, predictions of world peace? Check. (Laughter)
											More arguing? Gold star on that one. (Laughter)

											I mean, YouTube is just a gold mine. (Laughter)

											So I study social media, which means,
											to a first approximation, I watch people argue.
											And if I had to pick a group that I think is
											our Invisible College, is our generation&#39;s collection of people
											trying to take these tools and to press it into service,
											not for more arguments, but for better arguments,
											I&#39;d pick the open-source programmers.
											Programming is a three-way relationship
											between a programmer, some source code,
											and the computer it&#39;s meant to run on, but computers
											are such famously inflexible interpreters of instructions
											that it&#39;s extraordinarily difficult to write out a set
											of instructions that the computer knows how to execute,
											and that&#39;s if one person is writing it.
											Once you get more than one person writing it,
											it&#39;s very easy for any two programmers to overwrite
											each other&#39;s work if they&#39;re working on the same file,
											or to send incompatible instructions
											that simply causes the computer to choke,
											and this problem grows larger
											the more programmers are involved.
											To a first approximation, the problem of managing
											a large software project is the problem
											of keeping this social chaos at bay.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now, for decades there has been a canonical solution
											to this problem, which is to use something called
											a &quot;version control system,&quot;
											and a version control system does what is says on the tin.
											It provides a canonical copy of the software
											on a server somewhere.
											The only programmers who can change it are people
											who&#39;ve specifically been given permission to access it,
											and they&#39;re only allowed to access the sub-section of it
											that they have permission to change.
											And when people draw diagrams of version control systems,
											the diagrams always look something like this.
											All right. They look like org charts.
											And you don&#39;t have to squint very hard
											to see the political ramifications of a system like this.
											This is feudalism: one owner, many workers.

											But there was one programmer who decided
											that this wasn&#39;t the way to work.
											This is Linus Torvalds.
											Torvalds is the most famous open-source programmer,
											created Linux, obviously, and Torvalds looked at the way
											the open-source movement had been dealing with this problem.
											Open-source software, the core promise of the open-source license,
											is that everybody should have access to all the source code
											all the time, but of course, this creates
											the very threat of chaos you have to forestall
											in order to get anything working.
											So most open-source projects just held their noses
											and adopted the feudal management systems.

									<p>
											But Torvalds said, &quot;No, I&#39;m not going to do that.&quot;
											His point of view on this was very clear.
											When you adopt a tool, you also adopt
											the management philosophy embedded in that tool,
											and he wasn&#39;t going to adopt anything that didn&#39;t work
											the way the Linux community worked.
											And to give you a sense of how enormous
											a decision like this was, this is a map
											of the internal dependencies within Linux,
											within the Linux operating system, which sub-parts
											of the program rely on which other sub-parts to get going.
											This is a tremendously complicated process.
											This is a tremendously complicated program,
											and yet, for years, Torvalds ran this
											not with automated tools but out of his email box.
											People would literally mail him changes
											that they&#39;d agreed on, and he would merge them by hand.

											And he called it &quot;Git.&quot; Git is distributed version control.
											It has two big differences
											with traditional version control systems.
											The first is that it lives up to the philosophical promise
											of open-source. Everybody who works on a project
											has access to all of the source code all of the time.
											And when people draw diagrams of Git workflow,
											they use drawings that look like this.
											And you don&#39;t have to understand what the circles
											and boxes and arrows mean to see that this is a far more
											complicated way of working than is supported
											by ordinary version control systems.

											But this is also the thing that brings the chaos back,
											and this is Git&#39;s second big innovation.
											This is a screenshot from GitHub, the premier Git hosting service,
											and every time a programmer uses Git
											to make any important change at all,
											creating a new file, modifying an existing one,
											merging two files, Git creates this kind of signature.
											This long string of numbers and letters here
											is a unique identifier tied to every single change,
											but without any central coordination.
											Every Git system generates this number the same way,
											which means this is a signature tied directly
											and unforgeably to a particular change.

											This has the following effect:
											A programmer in Edinburgh and a programmer in Entebbe
											can both get the same — a copy of the same piece of software.
											Each of them can make changes and they can merge them
											after the fact even if they didn&#39;t know
											of each other&#39;s existence beforehand.
											This is cooperation without coordination.

											There&#39;s no democracy worth the name that doesn&#39;t have
											a transparency move, but transparency is openness
											in only one direction, and being given a dashboard
											without a steering wheel has never been the core promise
											a democracy makes to its citizens.

											So consider this.
											The thing that got Martha Payne&#39;s opinions
											out into the public was a piece of technology,
											but the thing that kept them there was political will.
											It was the expectation of the citizens
											that she would not be censored.
											That&#39;s now the state we&#39;re in with these collaboration tools.
											We have them. We&#39;ve seen them. They work.
											Can we use them?

											T.S. Eliot once said, &quot;One of the most momentous things

											I think that&#39;s wrong, but — (Laughter)
											I think it&#39;s right for argumentation. Right?
											A momentous thing that can happen to a culture

											A new form of arguing has been invented in our lifetimes,
											in the last decade, in fact.
											It&#39;s large, it&#39;s distributed, it&#39;s low-cost,
											and it&#39;s compatible with the ideals of democracy.
											The question for us now is, are we going to let

											Or are we going to try and take it and press it into service
											for society at large?
