<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Greece has been the poster child for European economic crisis, but former Prime Minister George Papandreou wonders if it&#39;s just a preview of what&#39;s to come. “Our democracies,&quot; he says, &quot;are trapped by systems that are too big to fail, or more accurately, too big to control” -- while &quot;politicians like me have lost the trust of their peoples.&quot; How to solve it?

<meta content='Greece has been the poster child for European economic crisis, but former Prime Minister George Papandreou wonders if it&#x0027;s just a preview of what&#x0027;s to come. “Our democracies," he says, "are trapped by systems that are too big to fail, or more accurately, too big to control” — while "politicians like me have lost the trust of their peoples." How to solve it? Have citizens re-engage more directly in a new democratic bargain.' itemprop='description'>

											Failure of leadership.
											What is the failure of leadership today?
											And why is our democracy not working?
											Well, I believe that the failure of leadership is the fact
											that we have taken you out of the process.
											So let me, from my personal experiences,
											give you an insight, so that you can step back
											and maybe understand why it is so difficult to cope
											with the challenges of today and why politics
											is going down a blind alley.

											Let&#39;s start from the beginning.
											Let&#39;s start from democracy.
											Well, if you go back to the Ancient Greeks,
											it was a revelation, a discovery,
											that we had the potential, together,
											to be masters of our own fate,
											to be able to examine, to learn, to imagine,
											and then to design a better life.
											And democracy was the political innovation
											which protected this freedom,
											because we were liberated from fear
											so that our minds in fact,
											whether they be despots or dogmas,
											could be the protagonists.
											Democracy was the political innovation that allowed us
											to limit the power, whether it was of tyrants
											or of high priests,
											their natural tendency to maximize power and wealth.

											Well, I first began to understand this
											when I was 14 years old.
											I used to, to try to avoid homework,
											sneak down to the living room and listen to my parents
											and their friends debate heatedly.
											You see, then Greece was
											under control of a very powerful establishment
											which was strangling the country,
											and my father was heading a promising movement
											to reimagine Greece, to imagine a Greece
											where freedom reigned and where, maybe,
											the people, the citizens, could actually rule their own country.

											Now, today, our democracies are again
											facing a moment of truth.
											Let me tell you a story.
											Sunday evening,
											Brussels, April 2010.
											I&#39;m sitting with my counterparts in the European Union.
											I had just been elected prime minister,
											but I had the unhappy privilege of revealing a truth
											that our deficit was not 6 percent,
											as had been officially reported only a few days earlier
											before the elections by the previous government,
											but actually 15.6 percent.
											But the deficit was only the symptom
											of much deeper problems that Greece was facing,
											and I had been elected on a mandate, a mission, actually,
											to tackle these problems,
											whether it was lack of transparency
											and accountability in governance,
											or whether it was a clientelistic state
											offering favors to the powerful — tax avoidance
											abetted and aided by a global tax evasion system,
											politics and media captured by special interests.
											But despite our electoral mandate,
											the markets mistrusted us.
											Our borrowing costs were skyrocketing,
											and we were facing possible default.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So I went to Brussels on a mission
											to make the case for a united European response,
											one that would calm the markets and give us the time
											to make the necessary reforms.
											But time we didn&#39;t get.
											Picture yourselves around the table in Brussels.
											Negotiations are difficult, the tensions are high,
											progress is slow, and then, 10 minutes to 2,
											a prime minister shouts out,
											&quot;We have to finish in 10 minutes.&quot;
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											I said, &quot;Why? These are important decisions.
											Let&#39;s deliberate a little bit longer.&quot;

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">

											Another prime minister comes in and says,
											&quot;No, we have to have an agreement now,

											and there will be havoc in the global economy.&quot;

									<p>
											We quickly came to a decision in those 10 minutes.
											This time it was not the military,
											but the markets, that put a gun to our collective heads.
											What followed were the most difficult decisions in my life,
											painful to me, painful to my countrymen,
											imposing cuts, austerity,
											often on those not to blame for the crisis.
											With these sacrifices, Greece did avoid bankruptcy
											and the eurozone avoided a collapse.

											Greece, yes, triggered the Euro crisis,
											and some people blame me for pulling the trigger.
											But I think today that most would agree
											that Greece was only a symptom
											of much deeper structural problems in the eurozone,
											vulnerabilities in the wider global economic system,
											vulnerabilities of our democracies.
											Our democracies are trapped by systems too big to fail,
											or, more accurately, too big to control.
											Our democracies are weakened in the global economy
											with players that can evade laws, evade taxes,
											evade environmental or labor standards.
											Our democracies are undermined
											by the growing inequality
											and the growing concentration of power and wealth,
											lobbies, corruption, the speed of the markets
											or simply the fact that we sometimes fear an impending disaster,
											have constrained our democracies,
											and they have constrained our capacity
											to imagine and actually use the potential, your potential,
											in finding solutions.

											Greece, you see, was only a preview
											of what is in store for us all.
											I, overly optimistically, had hoped
											that this crisis was an opportunity for Greece, for Europe,
											for the world, to make radical democratic transformations
											in our institutions.
											Instead, I had a very humbling experience.
											In Brussels, when we tried desperately again and again
											to find common solutions,
											I realized that not one, not one of us,
											had ever dealt with a similar crisis.
											But worse, we were trapped by our collective ignorance.
											We were led by our fears.
											And our fears led to a blind faith
											in the orthodoxy of austerity.
											Instead of reaching out to the common
											or the collective wisdom in our societies,
											investing in it to find more creative solutions,
											we reverted to political posturing.
											And then we were surprised when every
											ad hoc new measure didn&#39;t bring an end to the crisis,
											and of course that made it very easy
											to look for a whipping boy
											for our collective European failure,
											and of course that was Greece.
											Those profligate, idle, ouzo-swilling, Zorba-dancing Greeks,
											they are the problem. Punish them!
											Well, a convenient but unfounded stereotype
											that sometimes hurt even more than austerity itself.

									<p>
											But let me warn you, this is not just about Greece.
											This could be the pattern
											that leaders follow again and again
											when we deal with these complex, cross-border problems,
											whether it&#39;s climate change, whether it&#39;s migration,
											whether it&#39;s the financial system.
											That is, abandoning our collective power
											to imagine our potential,
											falling victims to our fears, our stereotypes, our dogmas,
											taking our citizens out of the process
											rather than building the process around our citizens.
											And doing so will only test the faith
											of our citizens, of our peoples, even more
											in the democratic process.

											It&#39;s no wonder that many political leaders,
											and I don&#39;t exclude myself,
											have lost the trust of our people.
											When riot police have to protect parliaments,
											a scene which is increasingly common around the world,
											then there&#39;s something deeply wrong with our democracies.
											That&#39;s why I called for a referendum to have the Greek people
											own and decide on the terms of the rescue package.
											My European counterparts, some of them, at least,
											said, &quot;You can&#39;t do this.
											There will be havoc in the markets again.&quot;

											Since leaving office, I have had time to reflect.
											We have weathered the storm, in Greece and in Europe,
											but we remain challenged.
											If politics is the power to imagine and use our potential,
											well then 60-percent youth unemployment in Greece,
											and in other countries, certainly is a lack of imagination
											if not a lack of compassion.
											So far, we&#39;ve thrown economics at the problem,
											actually mostly austerity,
											and certainly we could have designed alternatives,
											a different strategy, a green stimulus for green jobs,
											or mutualized debt, Eurobonds which would
											support countries in need from market pressures,
											these would have been much more viable alternatives.
											Yet I have come to believe that the problem is not so much
											one of economics as it is one of democracy.

									<p>
											So let&#39;s try something else.
											Let&#39;s see how we can bring people back to the process.
											Let&#39;s throw democracy at the problem.
											Again, the Ancient Greeks, with all their shortcomings,
											believed in the wisdom of the crowd
											at their best moments. In people we trust.
											Democracy could not work without the citizens
											deliberating, debating, taking on public responsibilities
											for public affairs.
											Average citizens often were chosen for citizen juries
											to decide on critical matters of the day.
											Science, theater, research, philosophy,
											games of the mind and the body,
											they were daily exercises.
											Actually they were an education for participation,
											for the potential, for growing the potential of our citizens.

											And those who shunned politics, well, they were idiots.
											You see, in Ancient Greece, in ancient Athens,
											that term originated there.
											&quot;Idiot&quot; comes from the root &quot;idio,&quot; oneself.
											A person who is self-centered, secluded, excluded,
											someone who doesn&#39;t participate or even examine public affairs.
											And participation took place in the agora, the agora having two meanings,
											both a marketplace and a place where there was political deliberation.
											You see, markets and politics then were one, unified,
											accessible, transparent, because they gave power to the people.
											They serve the demos, democracy.
											Above government, above markets
											was the direct rule of the people.

											Well, this is exactly where I think Europe fits in.
											Europe, despite its recent failures,
											is the world&#39;s most successful cross-border peace experiment.
											So let&#39;s see if it can&#39;t be an experiment
											in global democracy, a new kind of democracy.
											Let&#39;s see if we can&#39;t design a European agora,
											not simply for products and services,
											but for our citizens, where they can work together,
											deliberate, learn from each other,
											exchange between art and cultures,
											where they can come up with creative solutions.
											Let&#39;s imagine that European citizens
											actually have the power to vote directly
											for a European president,
											or citizen juries chosen by lottery
											which can deliberate on critical and controversial issues,
											a European-wide referendum where our citizens,
											as the lawmakers, vote on future treaties.
											And here&#39;s an idea:
											Why not have the first truly European citizens
											by giving our immigrants,
											not Greek or German or Swedish citizenship,
											but a European citizenship?
											And make sure we actually empower
											the unemployed by giving them a voucher scholarship
											where they can choose to study anywhere in Europe.
											Where our common identity is democracy,
											where our education is through participation,
											and where participation builds trust
											and solidarity rather than exclusion and xenophobia.
											Europe of and by the people,
											a Europe, an experiment in deepening and widening
											democracy beyond borders.

											BG: You seem to suggest that the way forward
											is more Europe, and that is not to be an easy discourse
											right now in most European countries.
											It&#39;s rather the other way — more closed borders
											and less cooperation and maybe even stepping out
											of some of the different parts of the European construction.
											How do you reconcile that?

											GP: Well, I think one of the worst things that happened
											during this crisis is that we started a blame game.
											And the fundamental idea of Europe is that
											we can cooperate beyond borders,
											go beyond our conflicts and work together.
											And the paradox is that, because we have this blame game,
											we have less the potential to convince our citizens
											that we should work together,
											while now is the time when we really need
											to bring our powers together.

									<p>
											Now, more Europe for me is not simply
											giving more power to Brussels.
											It is actually giving more power to the citizens of Europe,
											that is, really making Europe a project of the people.
											So that, I think, would be a way to answer
											some of the fears that we have in our society.
