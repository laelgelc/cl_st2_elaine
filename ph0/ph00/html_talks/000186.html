											I had requested slides,
											kind of adamantly, 


											up till the — pretty much, last few days,
											but was denied access to a slide projector.
											(Laughter)
											I actually find them a lot more emotional —
											(Laughter)
											— and personal,
											and the neat thing about a slide projector
											is you can actually focus the work,
											unlike PowerPoint and some other programs.
											Now, I agree that
											you have to — yeah, there are certain concessions
											and, you know, if you use a slide projector,
											you&#39;re not able to have the bad type
											swing in from the back or the side, or up or down,
											but maybe that&#39;s an O.K. trade-off,
											to trade that off for a focus.
											(Laughter)
											It&#39;s a thought. Just a thought.
											And there&#39;s something nice about slides getting stuck.
											And the thing you really hope for
											is occasionally they burn up,
											which we won&#39;t see tonight. So.

											With that, let&#39;s get the first slide up here.
											This, as many of you have probably guessed,

											recently emptied beer can in Portugal.

											This — I had just arrived in Barcelona for the first time,

											I mean, how nice is that?
											Everything&#39;s gotten simpler in design,
											and here&#39;s this mega airport,
											and God, I just — I took a picture.
											I thought, God, that is the coolest thing I&#39;ve ever seen at an airport.
											Till a couple months later,
											I went back to the same airport —
											same plane, I think — and looked up,
											and it said C.
											(Laughter)
											It was only then that I realized
											it was simply a gate that I was coming into.

											I&#39;m a big believer in the emotion of design,
											and the message that&#39;s sent
											before somebody begins to read,
											before they get the rest of the information;
											what is the emotional response they get to the product,
											to the story, to the painting — whatever it is.
											That area of design interests me the most,
											and I think this for me is a real clear,
											very simplified version
											of what I&#39;m talking about.
											These are a couple of garage doors painted identical,
											situated next to each other.
											So, here&#39;s the first door. You know, you get the message.
											You know, it&#39;s pretty clear.
											Take a look at the second door and see
											if there&#39;s any different message.
											O.K., which one would you park in front of?
											(Laughter)
											Same color, same message, same words.
											The only thing that&#39;s different
											is the expression that the individual door-owner here put into the piece —
											and, again,
											which is the psycho-killer here?
											(Laughter)
											Yet it doesn&#39;t say that; it doesn&#39;t need to say that.
											I would probably park in front of the other one.

											I&#39;m sure a lot of you are aware
											that graphic design has gotten a lot simpler in the last
											five years or so.
											It&#39;s gotten so simple that it&#39;s already starting to kind of
											come back the other way again and get a little more expressive.
											But I was in Milan and saw this street sign,
											and was very happy to
											see that apparently this idea of minimalism
											has even been translated by the graffiti artist.
											(Laughter)
											And this graffiti artist has come along,

											This is from my second book.
											The first book is called, &quot;The End of Print,&quot;
											and it was done along with a film,
											working with William Burroughs.
											And &quot;The End of Print&quot; is now in its fifth printing.
											(Laughter)
											When I first contacted William Burroughs about being part of it,
											he said no; he said he didn&#39;t believe it was the end of print.
											And I said, well, that&#39;s fine;
											I just would love to have your input on this film and this book,
											and he finally agreed to it.
											And at the end of the film, he says in this great voice
											that I can&#39;t mimic but I&#39;ll kind of try, but not really, he says,
											&quot;I remember attending an exhibition called,
											&#39;Photography: The End of Painting.&#39;&quot;
											And then he says, &quot;And, of course, it wasn&#39;t at all.&quot;
											So, apparently when photography was perfected,
											there were people going around saying,
											that&#39;s it: you&#39;ve just ruined painting.

											So, this is from &quot;2nd Sight,&quot;
											a book I did on intuition.
											I think it&#39;s not the only ingredient in design,
											but possibly the most important.
											It&#39;s something everybody has.
											It&#39;s not a matter of teaching it;
											in fact, most of the schools tend to discount intuition
											as an ingredient of your working process
											because they can&#39;t quantify it:
											it&#39;s very hard to teach people the four steps to intuitive design,
											but we can teach you the four steps to a nice business card
											or a newsletter.
											So it tends to get discounted.
											This is a quote from Albert Einstein, who says,
											&quot;The intellect has little to do on the road to discovery.
											There comes a leap in consciousness —
											call it intuition or what you will —
											and the solution just comes to you, and you don&#39;t know from where or why.&quot;
											So, it&#39;s kind of like when somebody says, Who did that song?
											And the more you try to think about it,
											the further the answer gets from you,
											and the minute you stop thinking about it,
											your intuition gives you that answer, in a sense.

											I like this for a couple of reasons.
											If you&#39;ve had any design courses, they would teach you you can&#39;t read this.
											I think you eventually can and, more importantly, I think it&#39;s true.
											&quot;Don&#39;t mistake legibility for communication.&quot;
											Just because something&#39;s legible doesn&#39;t means it communicates.
											More importantly, it doesn&#39;t mean it communicates the right thing.
											So, what is the message sent before
											somebody actually gets into the material?
											And I think that&#39;s sometimes an overlooked area.

											This is working with Marshall McLuhan.
											I stayed and worked with his wife and son, Eric,
											and we came up with close to 600 quotes from Marshall
											that are just amazing in terms of being ahead of the times,
											predicting so much of what has happened
											in the advertising, television, media world.
											And so this book is called &quot;Probes.&quot; It&#39;s another word for quotes.
											And it&#39;s — a lot of them are never — have never been published before,
											and basically, I&#39;ve interpreted the different quotes.
											So, this was the contents page originally.
											When I got done it was 540 pages,
											and then the publisher, Gingko Press,
											ended up cutting it down considerably:
											it&#39;s just under 400 pages now.
											But I decided I liked this contents page —
											I liked the way it looks — so I kept it.

											So, a couple spreads from the book:
											here McLuhan says,
											&quot;The new media are not bridges between Man and Nature; they are Nature.&quot;
											&quot;The invention of printing did away with anonymity,
											fostering ideas of literary fame
											and the habit of considering intellectual effort as private property,&quot;
											which had never been done before printing.
											&quot;When new technologies impose themselves
											on societies long habituated to older technologies,
											anxieties of all kinds result.&quot;

											So, this is a project for Nine Inch Nails.
											And I only show it because it seemed like it got all this relevancy all of a sudden,
											and it was done right after 9/11.
											And I had recently discovered a bomb shelter
											in the backyard of a house I had bought in LA
											that the real estate person hadn&#39;t pointed out.
											(Laughter)
											There was some bomb shelter built, apparently in the &#39;60s Cuban missile crisis.
											And I asked the real estate guy what it was as we were walking by,
											and he goes, &quot;It&#39;s something to do with the sewage system.&quot;
											I was, O.K.; that&#39;s fine.
											I finally went down there, and it was this old rusted circular thing,
											and two beds, and very kind of creepy and weird.
											And also, surprisingly, it was done in kind of a cheap metal,
											and it had completely rusted through, and water everywhere, and spiders.
											And I thought, you know, what were they thinking?
											You&#39;d think maybe cement, possibly, or something.
											But anyway, I used this for a cover for the Nine Inch Nails DVD,

											And this to me is an extreme case
											of the power of emotion, of graphic design,
											even though, in fact, was a very generic poster at the time.

											What&#39;s next? What&#39;s next is going to be people.
											As we get more technically driven,
											the importance of people becomes more than it&#39;s ever been before.
											You have to utilize who you are in your work.
											Nobody else can do that: nobody else can pull from your background,
											from your parents, your upbringing, your whole life experience.
											If you allow that to happen, it&#39;s really the only way you can do some unique work,
											and you&#39;re going to enjoy the work a lot more as well.

											This is — I like found art; hand lettering&#39;s coming back in a big way,
											and I thought this was a great example of both.
											This lady&#39;s advertising for her lost pit bull.
											It&#39;s friendly — she&#39;s underlined friendly —
											that&#39;s probably why she calls it Hercules or Hercles. She can&#39;t spell.
											(Laughter)
											But more importantly,
											she&#39;s willing to give you 20 bucks to go find this lost pit bull.
											And I&#39;m thinking, yeah, right,
											I&#39;ll go look for a lost pit bill for 20 bucks.
											I have visions of people going down alleyways yelling out for Hercles,
											and you get charged by this thing and you go,
											oh, please be Hercles; please be the friendly one.
											(Laughter)
											I&#39;m sure she never found the dog, because I took the sign.

											But I was asked to give a talk at a conference in Sacramento a few years back.
											And the theme was courage, and they asked me to talk
											about how courageous it is to be a graphic designer.
											And I remembered seeing this photograph of my father,
											who was a test pilot, and he told me that
											when you signed up to become a test pilot,
											they told you that there was a 40 to 50 percent chance
											of death on the job.
											That&#39;s pretty high for most occupations.
											(Laughter)
											But, you know, the government would make a plane;
											they&#39;d say, go see if that one flies, would you?
											Some of them did; some of them didn&#39;t.

									<p>
											And I started thinking about some of these decisions I have to make
											between, like, serif versus san-serif.
											(Laughter)
											And for the most part, they&#39;re not real life-threatening.
											Why not experiment? Why not have some fun?
											Why not put some of yourself into the work?
											And when I was teaching, I used to always ask the students,
											What&#39;s the definition of a good job?
											And as teachers, after you get all the answers,
											you like to give them the correct answer.
											And the best one I&#39;ve heard — I&#39;m sure some of you have heard this —
											the definition of a good job is:
											If you could afford to — if money wasn&#39;t an issue —
											would you be doing that same work?
											And if you would, you&#39;ve got a great job.
											And if you wouldn&#39;t, what the heck are you doing?
											You&#39;re going to be dead a really long time.
											Thank you very much.
