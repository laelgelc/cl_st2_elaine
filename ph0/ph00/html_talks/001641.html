<title>Elizabeth Lesser: Say your truths and seek them in others | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: In a lyrical, unexpectedly funny talk about heavy topics such as frayed relationships and the death of a loved one, Elizabeth Lesser describes the healing process of putting aside pride and defensiveness to make way for soul-baring and truth-telling. &quot;You don&#39;t have to wait for a life-or-death situation to clean up the relationships that matter to you,&quot; she says. &quot;Be like a new kind of first responder ... the one to take the first courageous step toward the other.&quot;" />

<meta content='In a lyrical, unexpectedly funny talk about heavy topics such as frayed relationships and the death of a loved one, Elizabeth Lesser describes the healing process of putting aside pride and defensiveness to make way for soul-baring and truth-telling. "You don&#x0027;t have to wait for a life-or-death situation to clean up the relationships that matter to you," she says. "Be like a new kind of first responder ... the one to take the first courageous step toward the other."' itemprop='description'>

											Like many of us,
											I&#39;ve had several careers in my life,

											my first job set the foundation
for all of them.
											I was a home-birth midwife

valuable and sometimes surprising things,

											But those aren&#39;t the things
that stuck with me or guided me
											when I stopped being a midwife
and started other jobs.
											What stuck with me was this bedrock belief
											that each one of us comes into this world
with a unique worth.
											When I looked into the face of a newborn,
											I caught a glimpse of that worthiness,
											that sense of unapologetic selfhood,
											that unique spark.
											I use the word &quot;soul&quot;
to describe that spark,
											because it&#39;s the only word in English
that comes close to naming

											at the base of the uterus.
											And during labor,
it has to stretch from this

											Ouch!
											If you fight against that pain,

											I&#39;ll never forget the magic

of the universe took notice
											and sent in a wave of help.
											I never forgot that message,
											and now, when difficult
or painful things happen to me
											in my life or my work,
											of course at first I resist them,
											but then I remember
what I learned from the mothers:
											stay open.
											Stay curious.
											Ask the pain what it&#39;s come to deliver.

											It was a lesson about time.
											At the end of his life,
Albert Einstein concluded
											that our normal, hamster-wheel
experience of life
											is an illusion.
											We run round and round, faster and faster,
											trying to get somewhere.
											And all the while,
											underneath surface time
is this whole other dimension
											where the past and the present
and the future merge
											and become deep time.
											And there&#39;s nowhere to get to.

									<p>
											Albert Einstein called
this state, this dimension,
											&quot;only being.&quot;
											And he said when he experienced it,
											he knew sacred awe.
											When I was delivering babies,
											I was forced off the hamster wheel.
											Sometimes I had to sit for days,
hours and hours,
											just breathing with the parents;
											just being.
											And I got a big dose of sacred awe.

											So those are the three lessons
I took with me from midwifery.

step off your hamster wheel

											When I discovered I was my sister&#39;s match,
											I went into research mode.
											And I discovered that
											the premise of transplants
is pretty straightforward.
											You destroy all the bone marrow
in the cancer patient
											with massive doses of chemotherapy,
											and then you replace that marrow
											with several million healthy
marrow cells from a donor.
											And then you do everything you can
											to make sure that those new cells
engraft in the patient.
											I also learned that bone marrow
transplants are fraught with danger.
											If my sister made it
through the near-lethal chemotherapy,
											she still would face other challenges.
											My cells
											might attack her body.
											And her body might reject my cells.
											They call this rejection or attack,
											and both could kill her.

											Rejection. Attack.
											Those words had a familiar ring
											in the context of being siblings.
											My sister and I had
a long history of love,
											but we also had a long history
of rejection and attack,
											from minor misunderstandings
to bigger betrayals.
											We didn&#39;t have
the kind of the relationship
											where we talked about the deeper stuff;
											but, like many siblings and like people
in all kinds of relationships,
											we were hesitant to tell our truths,
											to reveal our wounds,

to call our &quot;soul marrow transplant?&quot;
											What if we faced any pain
we had caused each other,

											the cancer came roaring back,
											and this time there was nothing more
the doctors could do.
											They gave her just
a couple of months to live.

											The night before my sister died,

											She was so small and thin.
											I could see the blood pulsing in her neck.
											It was my blood, her blood, our blood.
											When she died, part of me would die, too.

to the pain of our past,

											My sister left me with so many things,

with just one of them.
											You don&#39;t have to wait
for a life-or-death situation
											to clean up the relationships
that matter to you,
											to offer the marrow of your soul
											and to seek it in another.
											We can all do this.
											We can be like a new kind
of first responder,
											like the one to take
the first courageous step
											toward the other,
											and to do something or try to do something
											other than rejection or attack.
											We can do this with our siblings

											We can do this with the disconnection
											and the discord all around us.
											We can do this for the soul of the world.

problems.","whylisten":"<p>Elizabeth Lesser is a bestselling author and the cofounder of Omega Institute, the renowned conference and retreat center located in Rhinebeck, New York. Lesser&#39;s first book,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://geni.us/uIQrQGe\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Seeker&#39;s Guide</em></a>, chronicles her years at Omega and distills lessons learned into a potent guide for growth and healing. Her <em>New York Times</em> bestselling book,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://geni.us/nKfE\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Broken Open: How Difficult Times Can Help Us Grow</em></a>&nbsp;(Random House), has sold more than 300,000 copies and has been translated into 20 languages. Her latest book,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://geni.us/b3w5\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Marrow: A Love Story</em></a>&nbsp;(Harper Collins/September 2016), is a memoir about Elizabeth and her younger sister, Maggie, and the process they went through when Elizabeth was the donor for Maggie&rsquo;s bone marrow transplant.</p><p>Lesser cofounded Omega Institute in 1977 -- a time when a variety of fresh ideas were sprouting in American culture. Since then, the institute has been at the forefront of holistic education, offering workshops and trainings in: integrative medicine, prevention, nutrition, and the mind/body connection; meditation and yoga; cross-cultural arts and creativity; ecumenical spirituality; and social change movements like women&#39;s empowerment and environmental sustainability. Lesser is also the cofounder of Omega&#39;s Women&#39;s Leadership Center, which grew out of the popular Women &amp; Power conference series featuring women leaders, activists, authors and artists from around the world. Each year more than 30,000 people participate in Omega&#39;s programs on its campus in Rhinebeck, New York and at urban and travel sites, and more than a million people visit its website for online learning.</p><p>A student of the Sufi master, Pir Vilayat Inayat Khan, for many years, Lesser has also studied with spiritual teachers, healers, psychologists and philosophers from other traditions. In 2008 she helped Oprah Winfrey produce a ten-week online seminar based on Eckhart Tolle&#39;s book, <em>A New Earth</em>. The webinar was viewed by more than 8 million people worldwide. She was a frequent host on Oprah&#39;s &quot;Soul Series,&quot; a weekly radio show on Sirius/XM, and a guest on Oprah&#39;s &quot;Super Soul Sunday.&quot; In 2011, she gave a TED Talk, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/elizabeth_lesser_take_the_other_to_lunch\" target=\"_blank\">Take &#39;the Other&#39; to lunch</a> ,&quot; in which she called for civility and understanding as we negotiate our differences as human beings.</p><p>Lesser attended Barnard College, where she studied literature, and San Francisco State University, where she received a teaching degree. In 2011 she received an honorary doctorate from the Institute of Transpersonal Psychology, in Palo Alto, California. Early in her career she was a midwife and birth educator. Today, besides writing and her work at Omega Institute, she lends her time to social and environmental causes&nbsp;and is an avid walker, cook and gardener. She lives with her family in New York&#39;s Hudson River Valley.</p>"}],"speaker_name":"Elizabeth Lesser","tags":["aging","communication","compassion","empathy","family","humanity","health","life","death","vulnerability","relationships"],"title":"Say your truths and seek them in others","video_type":{"id":"1","name":"TED Stage Talk"},"viewed_count":1586104}]}})</script></div>
