											Whenever I look
at any sort of social puzzle,
											I always apply the three basic
principles of moral psychology,
											and I think they&#39;ll help us here.
											So the first thing that you
have to always keep in mind
											when you&#39;re thinking about politics
											is that we&#39;re tribal.
											We evolved for tribalism.
											One of the simplest and greatest
insights into human social nature
											is the Bedouin proverb:
											&quot;Me against my brother;
											me and my brother against our cousin;
											me and my brother and cousins
against the stranger.&quot;
											And that tribalism allowed us
to create large societies
											and to come together
in order to compete with others.
											That brought us out of the jungle
and out of small groups,
											but it means that we have
eternal conflict.
											The question you have to look at is:
											What aspects of our society
are making that more bitter,
											and what are calming them down?

											JH: Oh, absolutely. This is just
a basic aspect of human social cognition.
											But we can also live together
really peacefully,
											and we&#39;ve invented all kinds
of fun ways of, like, playing war.
											I mean, sports, politics —
											these are all ways that we get
to exercise this tribal nature
											without actually hurting anyone.
											We&#39;re also really good at trade
and exploration and meeting new people.
											So you have to see our tribalism
as something that goes up or down —
											it&#39;s not like we&#39;re doomed
to always be fighting each other,
											but we&#39;ll never have world peace.

											JH: So this is, I think,
											where we&#39;re getting at what&#39;s possibly
the new left-right distinction.
											I mean, the left-right
as we&#39;ve all inherited it,
											comes out of the labor
versus capital distinction,
											and the working class, and Marx.
											But I think what we&#39;re seeing
now, increasingly,
											is a divide in all the Western democracies
											between the people
who want to stop at nation,
											the people who are more parochial —
											and I don&#39;t mean that in a bad way —
											people who have much more
of a sense of being rooted,
											they care about their town,
their community and their nation.
											And then those who are
anti-parochial and who —
											whenever I get confused, I just think
of the John Lennon song &quot;Imagine.&quot;
											&quot;Imagine there&#39;s no countries,
nothing to kill or die for.&quot;
											And so these are the people
who want more global governance,
											they don&#39;t like nation states,
they don&#39;t like borders.
											You see this all over Europe as well.
											There&#39;s a great metaphor guy —
actually, his name is Shakespeare —
											writing ten years ago in Britain.
											He had a metaphor:
											&quot;Are we drawbridge-uppers
or drawbridge-downers?&quot;

											JH: I think the big issue, especially
in Europe but also here,
											is the issue of immigration.
											And I think this is where
we have to look very carefully
											at the social science
about diversity and immigration.
											Once something becomes politicized,
											once it becomes something
that the left loves and the right —
											then even the social scientists
can&#39;t think straight about it.
											Now, diversity is good in a lot of ways.
											It clearly creates more innovation.
											The American economy
has grown enormously from it.
											Diversity and immigration
do a lot of good things.
											But what the globalists,
I think, don&#39;t see,
											what they don&#39;t want to see,

cuts social capital and trust.

											There&#39;s a very important
study by Robert Putnam,
											the author of &quot;Bowling Alone,&quot;
											looking at social capital databases.
											And basically, the more people
feel that they are the same,
											the more they trust each other,
											the more they can have
a redistributionist welfare state.
											Scandinavian countries are so wonderful
											because they have this legacy
of being small, homogenous countries.
											And that leads to
a progressive welfare state,
											a set of progressive
left-leaning values, which says,
											&quot;Drawbridge down!
The world is a great place.
											People in Syria are suffering —
we must welcome them in.&quot;
											And it&#39;s a beautiful thing.
											But if, and I was in Sweden
this summer,
											if the discourse in Sweden
is fairly politically correct
											and they can&#39;t talk about the downsides,
											you end up bringing a lot of people in.
											That&#39;s going to cut social capital,
											it makes it hard to have a welfare state
											and they might end up,
as we have in America,
											with a racially divided, visibly
racially divided, society.
											So this is all very
uncomfortable to talk about.
											But I think this is the thing,
especially in Europe and for us, too,
											we need to be looking at.

											JH: Yes, but I can make it
much more palatable
											by saying it&#39;s not necessarily about race.
											It&#39;s about culture.
											There&#39;s wonderful work by a political
scientist named Karen Stenner,
											who shows that when people have a sense
											that we are all united,
we&#39;re all the same,
											there are many people who have
a predisposition to authoritarianism.
											Those people aren&#39;t particularly racist
											when they feel as through

											to our social and moral order.
											But if you prime them experimentally
											by thinking we&#39;re coming apart,
people are getting more different,
											then they get more racist, homophobic,
they want to kick out the deviants.
											So it&#39;s in part that you get
an authoritarian reaction.

											that, if you emphasize
our cultural similarity,
											then race doesn&#39;t actually
matter very much.
											So an assimilationist
approach to immigration
											removes a lot of these problems.

											JH: The next principle of moral psychology
											is that intuitions come first,
strategic reasoning second.
											You&#39;ve probably heard
the term &quot;motivated reasoning&quot;
											or &quot;confirmation bias.&quot;
											There&#39;s some really interesting work
											on how our high intelligence
and our verbal abilities
											might have evolved
not to help us find out the truth,
											but to help us manipulate each other,
defend our reputation ...
											We&#39;re really, really good
at justifying ourselves.
											And when you bring
group interests into account,
											so it&#39;s not just me,
it&#39;s my team versus your team,
											whereas if you&#39;re evaluating evidence
that your side is wrong,
											we just can&#39;t accept that.
											So this is why you can&#39;t win
a political argument.
											If you&#39;re debating something,
											you can&#39;t persuade the person
with reasons and evidence,
											because that&#39;s not
the way reasoning works.

different threads all coming together.

											So in America, one of the big —
actually, America and Europe —
											one of the biggest ones is World War II.
											There&#39;s interesting research
from Joe Henrich and others
											that says if your country was at war,
											especially when you were young,
											then we test you 30 years later
in a commons dilemma
											or a prisoner&#39;s dilemma,
											you&#39;re more cooperative.
											Because of our tribal nature, if you&#39;re —
											my parents were teenagers
during World War II,
											and they would go out
looking for scraps of aluminum
											to help the war effort.
											I mean, everybody pulled together.
											And so then these people go on,
											they rise up through business
and government,
											they take leadership positions.
											They&#39;re really good
at compromise and cooperation.
											They all retire by the &#39;90s.
											So we&#39;re left with baby boomers
by the end of the &#39;90s.
											And their youth was spent fighting
each other within each country,
											in 1968 and afterwards.
											The loss of the World War II generation,
&quot;The Greatest Generation,&quot;
											is huge.
											So that&#39;s one.

											Another, in America,
is the purification of the two parties.
											There used to be liberal Republicans
and conservative Democrats.
											So America had a mid-20th century
that was really bipartisan.
											But because of a variety of factors
that started things moving,
											by the 90&#39;s, we had a purified
liberal party and conservative party.
											So now, the people in either party
really are different,
											and we really don&#39;t want
our children to marry them,
											which, in the &#39;60s,
didn&#39;t matter very much.

											We&#39;re seeing more the urge
to keep people off campus,
											silence them, keep them away.
											I&#39;m afraid that this whole
generation of young people,
											if their introduction to politics
involves a lot of disgust,
											they&#39;re not going to want to be involved
in politics as they get older.

											JH: You can&#39;t do it with reasons.
											I think ...
											I studied disgust for many years,
and I think about emotions a lot.
											And I think that the opposite
of disgust is actually love.
											Love is all about, like ...
											Disgust is closing off, borders.
											Love is about dissolving walls.
											So personal relationships, I think,
											are probably the most
powerful means we have.
											You can be disgusted by a group of people,
											but then you meet a particular person
											and you genuinely discover
that they&#39;re lovely.
											And then gradually that chips away
or changes your category as well.
											The tragedy is, Americans used to be
much more mixed up in the their towns
											by left-right or politics.
											And now that it&#39;s become
this great moral divide,
											there&#39;s a lot of evidence
that we&#39;re moving to be near people
											who are like us politically.
											It&#39;s harder to find somebody
who&#39;s on the other side.
											So they&#39;re over there, they&#39;re far away.
											It&#39;s harder to get to know them.

											JH: Yes.
											A really important
thing to keep in mind —
											there&#39;s research by political
scientist Alan Abramowitz,
											showing that American democracy
is increasingly governed
											by what&#39;s called &quot;negative partisanship.&quot;
											That means you think,
OK there&#39;s a candidate,
											you like the candidate,
you vote for the candidate.
											But with the rise of negative advertising
											and social media
and all sorts of other trends,
											increasingly, the way elections are done
											is that each side tries to make
the other side so horrible, so awful,
											that you&#39;ll vote for my guy by default.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And so as we more and more vote
against the other side
											and not for our side,
											you have to keep in mind
that if people are on the left,
											they think, &quot;Well, I used to think
that Republicans were bad,
											but now Donald Trump proves it.
											And now every Republican,
I can paint with all the things
											that I think about Trump.&quot;
											And that&#39;s not necessarily true.
											They&#39;re generally not very happy

									<p>
											This is the most negative partisanship
election in American history.
											So you have to first separate
your feelings about the candidate
											from your feelings about the people
who are given a choice.
											And then you have to realize that,
											because we all live
in a separate moral world —
											the metaphor I use in the book
is that we&#39;re all trapped in &quot;The Matrix,&quot;
											or each moral community is a matrix,
a consensual hallucination.
											And so if you&#39;re within the blue matrix,
											everything&#39;s completely compelling
that the other side —
											they&#39;re troglodytes, they&#39;re racists,
they&#39;re the worst people in the world,
											and you have all the facts
to back that up.
											But somebody in the next house from yours
											is living in a different moral matrix.
											They live in a different video game,
											and they see a completely
different set of facts.
											And each one sees
different threats to the country.
											And what I&#39;ve found
from being in the middle
											and trying to understand both sides
is: both sides are right.
											There are a lot of threats
to this country,
											and each side is constitutionally
incapable of seeing them all.

											CA: So, are you saying
that we almost need a new type of empathy?
											Empathy is traditionally framed as:

											JH: Actually, I think ...
											Empathy is a very, very
hot topic in psychology,
											and it&#39;s a very popular word
on the left in particular.
											Empathy is a good thing, and empathy
for the preferred classes of victims.
											So it&#39;s important to empathize
											with the groups that we on the left
think are so important.
											That&#39;s easy to do,

									<p>
											But empathy really should get you points
if you do it when it&#39;s hard to do.
											And, I think ...
											You know, we had a long 50-year period
of dealing with our race problems
											and legal discrimination,
											and that was our top priority
for a long time
											and it still is important.
											But I think this year,
											I&#39;m hoping it will make people see
											that we have an existential
threat on our hands.
											Our left-right divide, I believe,
											is by far the most important
divide we face.
											We still have issues about race
and gender and LGBT,
											but this is the urgent need
of the next 50 years,
											and things aren&#39;t going
to get better on their own.
											So we&#39;re going to need to do
a lot of institutional reforms,
											and we could talk about that,
											but that&#39;s like a whole long,
wonky conversation.
											But I think it starts with people
realizing that this is a turning point.
											And yes, we need a new kind of empathy.
											We need to realize:
											this is what our country needs,
											and this is what you need
if you don&#39;t want to —
											Raise your hand if you want
to spend the next four years
											as angry and worried as you&#39;ve been
for the last year — raise your hand.
											So if you want to escape from this,
											read Buddha, read Jesus,
read Marcus Aurelius.
											They have all kinds of great advice
for how to drop the fear,
											reframe things,
											stop seeing other people as your enemy.
											There&#39;s a lot of guidance in ancient
wisdom for this kind of empathy.

											JH: Yeah, it&#39;s very hard to just decide
to overcome your deepest prejudices.
											And there&#39;s research showing
											that political prejudices are deeper
and stronger than race prejudices
											in the country now.
											So I think you have to make an effort —
that&#39;s the main thing.
											Make an effort to actually meet somebody.
											Everybody has a cousin, a brother-in-law,
											somebody who&#39;s on the other side.
											So, after this election —
											wait a week or two,
											because it&#39;s probably going to feel
awful for one of you —
											but wait a couple weeks, and then
reach out and say you want to talk.

He spent his early years in India, Pakistan and Afghanistan, where his parents worked as medical missionaries, and he attended an American school in the Himalayas for his early education. After boarding school in Bath, England, he went on to Oxford University, graduating in 1978 with a degree in philosophy, politics and economics.</p><p class=\"p1\">Chris then trained as a journalist, working in newspapers and radio, including two years producing a world news service in the Seychelles Islands.</p><p class=\"p1\"> Back in the UK in 1984, Chris was captivated by the personal computer revolution and became an editor at one of the UK&#39;s early computer magazines. A year later he founded Future Publishing with a $25,000 bank loan. The new company initially focused on specialist computer publications but eventually expanded into other areas such as cycling, music, video games, technology and design, doubling in size every year for seven years. In 1994, Chris moved to the United States where he built Imagine Media, publisher of <em>Business 2.0</em> magazine and creator of the popular video game users website IGN. Chris eventually merged Imagine and Future, taking the combined entity public in London in 1999, under the Future name. At its peak, it published 150 magazines and websites and employed 2,000 people.</p><p class=\"p1\">This success allowed Chris to create a private nonprofit organization, the Sapling Foundation, with the hope of finding new ways to tackle tough global issues through media, technology, entrepreneurship and, most of all, ideas. In 2001, the foundation acquired the TED Conference, then an annual meeting of luminaries in the fields of Technology, Entertainment and Design held in Monterey, California, and Chris left Future to work full time on TED.</p><p class=\"p1\">He expanded the conference&#39;s remit to cover all topics, including science, business and key global issues, while adding a Fellows program, which now has some 300 alumni, and the TED Prize, which grants its recipients &quot;one wish to change the world.&quot; The TED stage has become a place for thinkers and doers from all fields to share their ideas and their work, capturing imaginations, sparking conversation and encouraging discovery along the way.</p><p class=\"p1\">In 2006, TED experimented with posting some of its talks on the Internet. Their viral success encouraged Chris to begin positioning the organization as a global media initiative devoted to &#39;ideas worth spreading,&#39; part of a new era of information dissemination using the power of online video. In June 2015, the organization posted its 2,000th talk online. The talks are free to view, and they have been translated into more than 100 languages with the help of volunteers from around the world. Viewership has grown to approximately one billion views per year.</p><p class=\"p1\">Continuing a strategy of &#39;radical openness,&#39; in 2009 Chris introduced the TEDx initiative, allowing free licenses to local organizers who wished to organize their own TED-like events. More than 8,000 such events have been held, generating an archive of 60,000 TEDx talks. And three years later, the TED-Ed program was launched, offering free educational videos and tools to students and teachers.</p>"}],"url":"https://www.ted.com/talks/jonathan_haidt_can_a_divided_america_heal","viewed_count":1950827,"talks":[{"recommendations":{"status":"approved","headline":"Jonathan Haidt recommends","blurb":"Check out more reading resources on political division, curated by Jonathan Haidt.","start_at":null,"end_at":null,"published":true,"eyebrow":null,"type":"recommendation","rec_lists":[{"title":"","description":"","rec_items":[{"label":"READ_Article","headline":"\"The top 10 reasons American politics are so broken\"","blurb":"","note":"Jonathan Haidt and Sam Abrams\r\n*The Washington Post*, January 7, 2015","link_url":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/01/07/the-top-10-reasons-american-politics-are-worse-than-ever/","position":null,"is_pdf":false,"eyebrow":null},{"label":"READ_Article","headline":"\"When and Why Nationalism Beats Globalism\"","blurb":"","note":"Jonathan Haidt\r\nThe American Interest, July 10, 2016","link_url":"http://www.the-american-interest.com/2016/07/10/when-and-why-nationalism-beats-globalism/","position":null,"is_pdf":false,"eyebrow":null}]}]},"more_resources":[{"status":"approved","headline":"To improve democracies","blurb":"**CivilPolitics.org** educates groups and individuals who are trying to bridge moral divisions by connecting them with scientific research into the political domain.","link_url":"http://civilpolitics.org/","image_url":"","visible_url":"civilpolitics.org","start_at":null,"end_at":null,"published":true,"eyebrow":null,"type":"external_website"},{"status":"approved","headline":"To improve universities","blurb":"**HeterodoxAcademy.org** is politically diverse group of social scientists, natural scientists, humanists, and other scholars who share a concern about a growing problem: the loss or lack of \"viewpoint diversity.\"","link_url":"http://heterodoxacademy.org/","image_url":"","visible_url":"heterodoxacademy.org","start_at":null,"end_at":null,"published":true,"eyebrow":null,"type":"external_website"},{"status":"approved","headline":"To improve business ethics","blurb":"**EthicalSystems.org** makes the world's best research available and accessible, for free, to anyone interested in improving the ethical culture and behavior of an organization.

to be moral and political creatures.","whylisten":"<p>By understanding more about our moral psychology and its biases, Jonathan Haidt says we can design better institutions (including companies, universities and democracy itself), and we can learn to be more civil and open-minded toward those who are not on our team.</p><p>Haidt is a social psychologist whose research on morality across cultures led to his <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/jonathan_haidt_on_the_moral_mind.html\" target=\"_blank\">2008 TED Talk</a>&nbsp;on the psychological roots of the American culture war, and his 2013 TED Talk on how &quot;common threats can make common ground.&quot; In both of those talks he asks, &quot;Can&#39;t we all disagree more constructively?&quot; Haidt&#39;s&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/jonathan_haidt_humanity_s_stairway_to_self_transcendence\" target=\"_blank\">2012 TED Talk</a>&nbsp;explored the intersection of his work on morality with his work on happiness to talk about &quot;hive psychology&quot; -- the ability that humans have to lose themselves in groups pursuing larger projects, almost like bees in a hive. This hivish ability is crucial, he argues, for understanding the origins of morality, politics, and religion. These are ideas that Haidt develops at greater length in his book, <a href=\"http://righteousmind.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Righteous Mind: Why Good People are Divided by Politics and Religion</em></a>.</p><p>Haidt joined New York University Stern School of Business in July 2011. He is the Thomas Cooley Professor of Ethical Leadership, based in the Business and Society Program. Before coming to Stern, Professor Haidt taught for 16 years at the University of Virginia in the department of psychology.</p><p>Haidt&#39;s writings appear frequently in the <em>New York Times</em> and <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>. He was named one of the top global thinkers by Foreign Policy magazine and by Prospect magazine. Haidt received a B.A. in Philosophy from Yale University, and an M.A. and Ph.D. in Psychology from the University of Pennsylvania.</p>"},{"id":"187","slug":"chris_anderson_ted","is_published":true,"firstname":"Chris","lastname":"Anderson","middleinitial":"","title":"","description":"Head of TED","photo_url":"https://pe.tedcdn.com/images/ted/15a78b07d0340fcf8f391e7529b6f4b050a60cc0_254x191.jpg","whatotherssay":"","whotheyare":"After a long career in journalism and publishing, Chris Anderson became the curator of the TED Conference in 2002 and has developed it as a platform for identifying and disseminating ideas worth spreading.","whylisten":"<p class=\"p1\">Chris Anderson is the Curator of TED, a nonprofit devoted to sharing valuable ideas, primarily through the medium of &#39;TED Talks&#39; -- short talks that are offered free online to a global audience.</p><p class=\"p1\">Chris was born in a remote village in Pakistan in 1957. He spent his early years in India, Pakistan and Afghanistan, where his parents worked as medical missionaries, and he attended an American school in the Himalayas for his early education. After boarding school in Bath, England, he went on to Oxford University, graduating in 1978 with a degree in philosophy, politics and economics.</p><p class=\"p1\">Chris then trained as a journalist, working in newspapers and radio, including two years producing a world news service in the Seychelles Islands.</p><p class=\"p1\"> Back in the UK in 1984, Chris was captivated by the personal computer revolution and became an editor at one of the UK&#39;s early computer magazines. A year later he founded Future Publishing with a $25,000 bank loan. The new company initially focused on specialist computer publications but eventually expanded into other areas such as cycling, music, video games, technology and design, doubling in size every year for seven years. In 1994, Chris moved to the United States where he built Imagine Media, publisher of <em>Business 2.0</em> magazine and creator of the popular video game users website IGN. Chris eventually merged Imagine and Future, taking the combined entity public in London in 1999, under the Future name. At its peak, it published 150 magazines and websites and employed 2,000 people.</p><p class=\"p1\">This success allowed Chris to create a private nonprofit organization, the Sapling Foundation, with the hope of finding new ways to tackle tough global issues through media, technology, entrepreneurship and, most of all, ideas. In 2001, the foundation acquired the TED Conference, then an annual meeting of luminaries in the fields of Technology, Entertainment and Design held in Monterey, California, and Chris left Future to work full time on TED.</p><p class=\"p1\">He expanded the conference&#39;s remit to cover all topics, including science, business and key global issues, while adding a Fellows program, which now has some 300 alumni, and the TED Prize, which grants its recipients &quot;one wish to change the world.&quot; The TED stage has become a place for thinkers and doers from all fields to share their ideas and their work, capturing imaginations, sparking conversation and encouraging discovery along the way.</p><p class=\"p1\">In 2006, TED experimented with posting some of its talks on the Internet. Their viral success encouraged Chris to begin positioning the organization as a global media initiative devoted to &#39;ideas worth spreading,&#39; part of a new era of information dissemination using the power of online video. In June 2015, the organization posted its 2,000th talk online. The talks are free to view, and they have been translated into more than 100 languages with the help of volunteers from around the world. Viewership has grown to approximately one billion views per year.</p><p class=\"p1\">Continuing a strategy of &#39;radical openness,&#39; in 2009 Chris introduced the TEDx initiative, allowing free licenses to local organizers who wished to organize their own TED-like events. More than 8,000 such events have been held, generating an archive of 60,000 TEDx talks. And three years later, the TED-Ed program was launched, offering free educational videos and tools to students and teachers.</p>"}],"speaker_name":"Jonathan Haidt","tags":["choice","community","communication","government","economics","identity","democracy","interview","inequality","media","peace","philosophy","psychology","policy","religion","security","social change","social media","sociology","society","United States","evolutionary psychology","TEDNYC"],"title":"Can a divided America heal?","video_type":{"id":"1","name":"TED Stage Talk"},"viewed_count":1950827}]}})</script></div>
