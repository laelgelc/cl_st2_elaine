											You all know this story.
											In the summer of 1950,
											Enrico Fermi, the Italian-American physicist
											and atomic-pile builder,
											went to lunch at Los Alamos National Laboratory
											and joined some colleagues there, and asked them a question:
											&quot;Where is everybody?&quot;
											This confused his colleagues, obviously,
											because they were sitting right there with him.
											And then he had to clarify that he wasn&#39;t talking about them.
											He was talking about the space aliens.

									<p>
											You see, this was only a few years after
											the supposed flying saucer crash
											at Roswell, New Mexico.
											And even though that turned out to be nothing,
											nothing at all —
											(Laughter) —
											merely a downed weather balloon
											piloted by small hairless men
											with slits for mouths ...
											Still, America had gone saucer-mad,
											even famous scientists
											who were eating lunch.
											Fermi&#39;s reasoning, if I may paraphrase badly,
											is that the universe is so vast
											that it stands to reason,
											there should be other intelligent life out there.
											And the universe is so old
											that unless we were the very first civilization ever to evolve,
											we should have some evidence of their existence by now.
											And yet, to the best of our knowledge, we are alone.

											&quot;Where is everybody?&quot; asked Fermi,
											and his colleagues had no answer.
											Fermi then went on with the same blunt logic
											to disprove fairies,
											Sasquatch, God,
											the possibility of love —
											and thereafter, as you know,
											Enrico Fermi ate alone.
											(Laughter)
											Now,
											I am not a scientist.
											I have never built an atomic pile.
											Although, I might argue that, technically,
											every pile is atomic.

											However, with respect, I might point out two possibilities

											One is that the aliens might be

											Perhaps, I dare say,

											The other possibility —

											Think about it.
											Isn&#39;t it a little convenient

											suddenly an Italian scientist showed up
											with an amazing new technology
											that would transform everything in the world
											and darken the history of the human species forever after?
											And isn&#39;t it a little strange

											And if Enrico Fermi were indeed a space alien,

											that the aliens are already here and have been for millennia;
											that they have walked among us in disguise,
											observing us, guiding our evolution
											from ape to man —

											and, occasionally, kidnapping us in their flying saucers

											Encounter one: Ocean City, New Jersey, 1980.
											This was the summer when the special edition of
											&quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot; was released.
											And I went on vacation with my parents to the Jersey shore.
											Within 12 hours, I was horribly sunburned,
											just like Richard Dreyfuss in the movie.

											And so I spent the rest of the vacation
											largely sitting outside our little rental house at night,
											the sidewalk still warm from the sun,
											watching the skies for UFOs.
											What did I see? Stars, satellites,
											blinking airplanes — typical sky junk.
											Occasionally, kids would come and
											join me and watch,
											but their necks soon got sore, and they would go off to the boardwalk
											to play video games and mingle with humans.
											I was pretty good at the video games. I was not very good at the other part,

											And that&#39;s when it happened.
											An elderly couple came walking down the street.
											I would say they were in their late seventies,
											and I would say that they were on a date,

											with a yellow tie — a brown suit.
											And she was wearing a cardigan, because it was now fully night
											and a chill was coming in off the ocean.
											I remember, for some reason,

											You have to admit, that&#39;s a pretty boss piece of detective work

											But what was stranger still —

											was that they stopped at all.
											That this old man would interrupt his moonlight stroll
											with his sweetheart with the precise reason
											of making fun of a child.
											&quot;Oh,&quot; he said,
											&quot;little green men.&quot;
											And then his girlfriend joined in, too.
											&quot;There&#39;s no such thing as space men,&quot; she said.
											&quot;There&#39;s no such thing.&quot;
											And then they both laughed. &quot;Ha, ha, ha.&quot;
											I looked around.
											The street was entirely empty.
											I had stopped hearing the sound of the ocean.
											It was as though time had stopped.
											I did not know why they were teasing me.
											I looked into their strangely angry faces,

											are they wearing rubber masks?

											&quot;Kew, kew, kew —
											watch out.&quot;
											And they turned at once and walked away.
											The old man reached out
											his knobbly claw
											for the woman&#39;s hand,

											Now, you could describe this as a simple misunderstanding —

											Close encounter two: Brookline, Massachusetts, 1984.
											I went to see the movie &quot;Dune,&quot;
											and a girl talked to me. Now, on its face —
											(Laughter) —
											this is impossible on its face, I realize —
											but it is absolutely true.
											It was opening night, naturally.
											I went with my friend Tim McGonigal, who sat on my left.
											On my right was the girl in question.
											She had long, curly black hair, a blue jean jacket.
											I remember, she had some sort of injury to her ankle,
											an Ace bandage, and she had crutches.
											She was very tall, I would say.
											I was starting high school at the time. I would say she was a junior,

											I didn&#39;t know her name, and I never will.
											She was sitting with someone who I presume was her mother,
											and they were talking about the novel, &quot;Dune.&quot;
											They were both big fans, mother and daughter —
											very unusual.
											They were talking about how their favorite characters
											were the giant sandworms.
											And then it got stranger.

											into that strange, alien land.

											It took me some time to come to my senses.
											I had my own &quot;lost time&quot; moment,
											where I woke up and suddenly realized
											it was very late in the day, almost dinnertime,
											and she had not come back.
											Nervous, I went down to the street to look for her.
											Now, I did not speak Portuguese.
											I did not know where the beach was.
											I could not call her on a cell phone because this was 1991,
											and the aliens had not given us that technology yet.

											I realized that the day would only have
											two possible outcomes:
											either Catherine would come back to the hotel,
											or she would never come back to the hotel.
											And so I sat down to wait.
											I did not watch the skies, but the very end of the street
											where the buses and cars and pedestrians
											and little scooters were moving along.
											And I watched those constellations shift,
											hoping that they would part and I would see her face.
											It was at that moment,
											in that very small town of 30,000 or so,
											that I truly appreciated the vastness of the universe
											and the searching we might do in it.
											And that&#39;s when the Liberians came along.
											Five young men — all laughing, happy, traveling together,
											coming back to this hotel where they were staying.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											One of them was named Joseph, and he asked me
											what was I doing, and I explained.
											And he said, &quot;Don&#39;t worry.&quot; He was sure that Catherine would be safe.
											But he did not seem so very sure,
											for he sat down to wait with me.
											And for the next two hours, they all waited with me:
											taking turns, going up to their room, coming back,
											telling me jokes, distracting me.
											Two hours, they gave me a message.
											We are not alone.

									<p>
											And then, in the middle of a sentence, at the very birth of twilight,
											I turned and looked down the street.
											The stars aligned, and she came back.
											She was smiling. She did not understand why I was so worried.
											Neither did the Liberians,
											although there was a huge amount of relief in their laughter
											as they clapped us on the back, and went back up to their room
											and left us alone in the street, holding hands.
											An event like this leaves a scar on the memory,
											much like a piece of alien technology
											that has been inserted into your buttocks
											by a &quot;Portuguese doctor.&quot;

											And even now, a decade and a half later,
											even now that we are married,
											I look for her still, whenever she is not in the room.
											And even though, I think you&#39;ll agree, it is probable
											that during the time she was away,
											she was kidnapped and replaced by an alien clone,
											I love her and wait for her still.
