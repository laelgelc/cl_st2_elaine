											Well, that&#39;s kind of an obvious statement up there.
											I started with that sentence about 12 years ago,
											and I started in the context
											of developing countries,
											but you&#39;re sitting here from every corner of the world.
											So if you think of a map of your country,
											I think you&#39;ll realize
											that for every country on Earth,
											you could draw little circles to say,
											&quot;These are places where good teachers won&#39;t go.&quot;
											On top of that,
											those are the places from where trouble comes.
											So we have an ironic problem —
											good teachers don&#39;t want to go
											to just those places where they&#39;re needed the most.

											I started in 1999
											to try and address this problem with an experiment,
											which was a very simple experiment in New Delhi.
											I basically embedded a computer
											into a wall of a slum in New Delhi.
											The children barely went to school, they didn&#39;t know any English —
											they&#39;d never seen a computer before,
											and they didn&#39;t know what the internet was.
											I connected high speed internet to it — it&#39;s about three feet off the ground —
											turned it on and left it there.
											After this,
											we noticed a couple of interesting things, which you&#39;ll see.
											But I repeated this all over India
											and then through
											a large part of the world
											and noticed
											that children will learn to do
											what they want to learn to do.

											This is the first experiment that we did —
											eight year-old boy on your right
											teaching his student, a six year-old girl,
											and he was teaching her how to browse.
											This boy here in the middle of central India —
											this is in a Rajasthan village,
											where the children recorded their own music
											and then played it back to each other
											and in the process,
											they&#39;ve enjoyed themselves thoroughly.
											They did all of this in four hours
											after seeing the computer for the first time.
											In another South Indian village,
											these boys here
											had assembled a video camera
											and were trying to take the photograph of a bumble bee.
											They downloaded it from Disney.com,
											or one of these websites,
											14 days after putting the computer in their village.
											So at the end of it,
											we concluded that groups of children
											can learn to use computers and the internet on their own,
											irrespective of who
											or where they were.

									<p>
											At that point, I became a little more ambitious
											and decided to see
											what else could children do with a computer.
											We started off with an experiment in Hyderabad, India,
											where I gave a group of children —
											they spoke English with a very strong Telugu accent.
											I gave them a computer
											with a speech-to-text interface,
											which you now get free with Windows,
											and asked them to speak into it.
											So when they spoke into it,
											the computer typed out gibberish,
											so they said, &quot;Well, it doesn&#39;t understand anything of what we are saying.&quot;
											So I said, &quot;Yeah, I&#39;ll leave it here for two months.
											Make yourself understood
											to the computer.&quot;
											So the children said, &quot;How do we do that.&quot;
											And I said,
											&quot;I don&#39;t know, actually.&quot;
											(Laughter)
											And I left.
											(Laughter)
											Two months later —
											and this is now documented
											in the Information Technology
											for International Development journal —
											that accents had changed
											and were remarkably close to the neutral British accent
											in which I had trained the speech-to-text synthesizer.
											In other words, they were all speaking like James Tooley.
											(Laughter)
											So they could do that on their own.
											After that, I started to experiment
											with various other things
											that they might learn to do on their own.

											I got an interesting phone call once from Columbo,
											from the late Arthur C. Clarke,
											who said, &quot;I want to see what&#39;s going on.&quot;
											And he couldn&#39;t travel, so I went over there.
											He said two interesting things,
											&quot;A teacher that can be replaced by a machine should be.&quot;
											(Laughter)
											The second thing he said was that,
											&quot;If children have interest,
											then education happens.&quot;
											And I was doing that in the field,
											so every time I would watch it and think of him.

											SM: And I asked him, &quot;Do you send emails?&quot;
											And he said, &quot;Yes, and they hop across the ocean.&quot;
											This is in Cambodia,
											rural Cambodia —
											a fairly silly arithmetic game,
											which no child would play inside the classroom or at home.
											They would, you know, throw it back at you.
											They&#39;d say, &quot;This is very boring.&quot;
											If you leave it on the pavement
											and if all the adults go away,
											then they will show off with each other
											about what they can do.
											This is what these children are doing.
											They are trying to multiply, I think.
											And all over India,
											at the end of about two years,
											children were beginning to Google their homework.
											As a result, the teachers reported
											tremendous improvements in their English —
											(Laughter)
											rapid improvement and all sorts of things.
											They said, &quot;They have become really deep thinkers and so on and so forth.
											(Laughter)
											And indeed they had.
											I mean, if there&#39;s stuff on Google,
											why would you need to stuff it into your head?
											So at the end of the next four years,
											I decided that groups of children can navigate the internet
											to achieve educational objectives on their own.

											At that time, a large amount of money
											had come into Newcastle University
											to improve schooling in India.
											So Newcastle gave me a call. I said, &quot;I&#39;ll do it from Delhi.&quot;
											They said, &quot;There&#39;s no way you&#39;re going to handle
											a million pounds-worth of University money
											sitting in Delhi.&quot;
											So in 2006,
											I bought myself a heavy overcoat
											and moved to Newcastle.
											I wanted to test the limits
											of the system.
											The first experiment I did out of Newcastle
											was actually done in India.
											And I set myself and impossible target:
											can Tamil speaking
											12-year-old children
											in a South Indian village
											teach themselves biotechnology
											in English on their own?
											And I thought, I&#39;ll test them, they&#39;ll get a zero —
											I&#39;ll give the materials, I&#39;ll come back and test them —
											they get another zero,
											I&#39;ll go back and say, &quot;Yes, we need teachers for certain things.&quot;

											I called in 26 children.
											They all came in there, and I told them
											that there&#39;s some really difficult stuff on this computer.
											I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if you didn&#39;t understand anything.
											It&#39;s all in English, and I&#39;m going.
											(Laughter)
											So I left them with it.
											I came back after two months,
											and the 26 children marched in looking very, very quiet.
											I said, &quot;Well, did you look at any of the stuff?&quot;
											They said, &quot;Yes, we did.&quot;
											&quot;Did you understand anything?&quot; &quot;No, nothing.&quot;
											So I said,
											&quot;Well, how long did you practice on it
											before you decided you understood nothing?&quot;
											They said, &quot;We look at it every day.&quot;
											So I said, &quot;For two months, you were looking at stuff you didn&#39;t understand?&quot;
											So a 12 year-old girl raises her hand and says,
											literally,
											&quot;Apart from the fact that improper replication of the DNA molecule

											It took me three years to publish that.

											One of the referees who refereed the paper said,

											Well, one of the girls had taught herself

											So their scores had gone up from zero to 30 percent,
											which is an educational impossibility under the circumstances.
											But 30 percent is not a pass.
											So I found that they had a friend,
											a local accountant, a young girl,
											and they played football with her.
											I asked that girl, &quot;Would you teach them
											enough biotechnology to pass?&quot;
											And she said, &quot;How would I do that? I don&#39;t know the subject.&quot;
											I said, &quot;No, use the method of the grandmother.&quot;
											She said, &quot;What&#39;s that?&quot;
											I said, &quot;Well, what you&#39;ve got to do
											is stand behind them
											and admire them all the time.
											Just say to them, &#39;That&#39;s cool. That&#39;s fantastic.
											What is that? Can you do that again? Can you show me some more?&#39;&quot;
											She did that for two months.
											The scores went up to 50,

											So I came back to Newcastle
											with these results

											that there was something happening here
											that definitely was getting very serious.
											So, having experimented in all sorts of remote places,
											I came to the most remote place that I could think of.
											(Laughter)
											Approximately 5,000 miles from Delhi
											is the little town of Gateshead.
											In Gateshead, I took 32 children
											and I started to fine-tune the method.
											I made them into groups of four.
											I said, &quot;You make your own groups of four.
											Each group of four can use one computer and not four computers.&quot;
											Remember, from the Hole in the Wall.
											&quot;You can exchange groups.
											You can walk across to another group,
											if you don&#39;t like your group, etc.
											You can go to another group, peer over their shoulders, see what they&#39;re doing,
											come back to you own group and claim it as your own work.&quot;
											And I explained to them
											that, you know, a lot of scientific research is done using that method.

											The children enthusiastically got after me and said,
											&quot;Now, what do you want us to do?&quot;
											I gave them six GCSE questions.
											The first group — the best one —
											solved everything in 20 minutes.
											The worst, in 45.
											They used everything that they knew —
											news groups, Google, Wikipedia,
											Ask Jeeves, etc.
											The teachers said, &quot;Is this deep learning?&quot;
											I said, &quot;Well, let&#39;s try it.
											I&#39;ll come back after two months.
											We&#39;ll give them a paper test —
											no computers, no talking to each other, etc.&quot;
											The average score when I&#39;d done it with the computers and the groups

											There was photographic recall

											I have further results,

											This is what I&#39;m building now —
											they&#39;re called SOLEs: Self Organized Learning Environments.
											The furniture is designed
											so that children can sit in front of big, powerful screens,
											big broadband connections, but in groups.
											If they want, they can call the granny cloud.
											This is a SOLE in Newcastle.
											The mediator is from Pune, India.

											So how far can we go? One last little bit and I&#39;ll stop.
											I went to Turin in May.
											I sent all the teachers away from my group of 10 year-old students.
											I speak only English, they speak only Italian,
											so we had no way to communicate.
											I started writing English questions on the blackboard.
											The children looked at it and said, &quot;What?&quot;
											I said, &quot;Well, do it.&quot;
											They typed it into Google, translated it into Italian,
											went back into Italian Google.
											Fifteen minutes later —
											next question: where is Calcutta?
											This one, they took only 10 minutes.
											I tried a really hard one then.
											Who was Pythagoras, and what did he do?
											There was silence for a while,
											then they said, &quot;You&#39;ve spelled it wrong.
											It&#39;s Pitagora.&quot;
											And then,
											in 20 minutes,
											the right-angled triangles began to appear on the screens.
											This sent shivers up my spine.
											These are 10 year-olds.
											Text: In another 30 minutes they would reach the Theory of Relativity. And then?

											SM: So you know what&#39;s happened?
											I think we&#39;ve just stumbled across
											a self-organizing system.
											A self-organizing system is one
											where a structure appears
											without explicit intervention from the outside.
											Self-organizing systems also always show emergence,
											which is that the system starts to do things,
											which it was never designed for.
											Which is why you react the way you do,
											because it looks impossible.
											I think I can make a guess now —
											education is self-organizing system,
											where learning is an emergent phenomenon.
											It&#39;ll take a few years to prove it, experimentally,
											but I&#39;m going to try.
											But in the meanwhile, there is a method available.
											One billion children, we need 100 million mediators —
											there are many more than that on the planet —
											10 million SOLEs,
											180 billion dollars and 10 years.
											We could change everything.

What they saw: kids from the slum playing with the computer and, in the process, learning how to use it -- then teaching each other. These famed &ldquo;Hole in the Wall&rdquo; experiments demonstrated that, in the absence of supervision and formal teaching, children can teach themselves and each other -- if they&rsquo;re motivated by curiosity. Mitra, now a professor of educational technology at <a href=\"http://egwestcentre.com/research/holeinthewall/\" target=\"_blank\">Newcastle University</a>, called it &quot;minimally invasive education.&quot;</p><p>Mitra thinks self-organized learning will shape the future of education.

learning that wasn’t possible before.","whotheyare":"Educational researcher Sugata Mitra is the winner of the 2013 TED Prize. His wish: Build a School in the Cloud, where children can explore and learn from one another.","whylisten":"<p>In 1999, Sugata Mitra and his colleagues dug a hole in a wall bordering an urban slum in New Delhi, installed an Internet-connected PC and left it there, with a hidden camera filming the area. What they saw: kids from the slum playing with the computer and, in the process, learning how to use it -- then teaching each other. These famed &ldquo;Hole in the Wall&rdquo; experiments demonstrated that, in the absence of supervision and formal teaching, children can teach themselves and each other -- if they&rsquo;re motivated by curiosity. Mitra, now a professor of educational technology at <a href=\"http://egwestcentre.com/research/holeinthewall/\" target=\"_blank\">Newcastle University</a>, called it &quot;minimally invasive education.&quot;</p><p>Mitra thinks self-organized learning will shape the future of education. At TED2013, he made a bold TED Prize wish: Help me build a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.ted.com/participate/ted-prize/prize-winning-wishes/school-in-the-cloud\" target=\"_blank\">School in the Cloud</a>&nbsp;where children can explore and learn on their own -- and teach one another -- using resouces from the worldwide cloud. </p><p>The School in the Cloud now includes seven physical locations -- five in India and two in the UK. At the same time, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theschoolinthecloud.org/\" target=\"_blank\">School in the Cloud online platform</a>&nbsp;lets students participate anywhere, with partner learning labs and programs&nbsp;in countries <a href=\"http://blog.ted.com/self-organized-learners-around-the-world-team-up-to-raise-money/\" target=\"_blank\">like Colombia, Pakistan and Greece</a>. In 2016, Mitra held the first School in the Cloud conference in India. He shared that more than 16,000 SOLE sessions had taken place so far, with kids all around the world dipping their toes in this new education model.</p>"}],"speaker_name":"Sugata Mitra","tags":["children","education","technology","web","global development","global issues"],"title":"The child-driven education","video_type":{"id":"1","name":"TED Stage Talk"},"viewed_count":3031976}]}})</script></div>
