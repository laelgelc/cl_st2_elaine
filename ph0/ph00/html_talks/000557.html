											So —
											I&#39;m a blogger, which, probably,
to a lot of you, means different things.
											You may have heard
about the Kryptonite lock brouhaha,
											where a blogger talked about how you hack
											or break into a Kryptonite
lock using a ballpoint pen,
											and it spread all over.
											Kryptonite had to adjust the lock,
											and they had to address it
to avoid too many customer concerns.
											You may have heard about Rathergate,
											which was basically the result of bloggers
											realizing that the &quot;th&quot; in 111
											is not typeset on an old typewriter;
											it&#39;s on Word.
											Bloggers exposed this,
											or they worked hard to expose this.
											You know, blogs are scary.
This is what you see.
											I see this, and I&#39;m sure scared —
I swear on stage — shitless about blogs,
											because this is not
something that&#39;s friendly.
											But there are blogs that are changing
the way we read news
											and consume media,
and these are great examples.
											These people are reaching thousands,
											if not millions, of readers,
											and that&#39;s incredibly important.
											During the hurricane,
											you had MSNBC posting
about the hurricane on their blog,
											updating it frequently.
											This was possible because of the easy
nature of blogging tools.

personal recorders.
											He makes enough money just by running ads,

											That&#39;s all he does now,
											and this is something
that blogs have made possible.
											And then you have something
like this, which is Interplast.
											It&#39;s a wonderful organization
											of people and doctors
who go to developing nations
											to offer plastic surgery
to those who need it.
											Children with cleft palates get it,
and they document their story.
											This is wonderful.

											I have always decided that I was going
to be an expert on one thing,

											So, the short story about my blog:
											it started in 2001, I was 23.
											I wasn&#39;t happy with my job,
											because I was a designer,
											but I wasn&#39;t being really stimulated.
											I was an English major in college.
											I didn&#39;t have any use for it,
but I missed writing.
											So, I started to write a blog
											and I started to create things
like these little stories.
											This was an illustration about my camp
experience when I was 11 years old,
											and how I went to a YMCA camp,
Christian camp,
											and basically by the end,
											I had made my friends hate me so much
that I hid in a bunk,
											They couldn&#39;t find me,
they sent a search party,
											and I overheard people saying
they wish I had killed myself —

											So, blogs.
											So what? You&#39;ve probably
heard these things before.
											We talked about the WELL,
and about all these sorts of things
											throughout our online history.
											But I think blogs are basically
just an evolution,
											and that&#39;s where we are today.
											It&#39;s this record
of who you are, your persona.
											You have your Google search,
where you say, &quot;What is Mena Trott?&quot;
											And then you find these things
and you&#39;re happy or unhappy.
											But then you also find people&#39;s blogs,
											and those are the records of people
that are writing daily —
											not necessarily about the same topic,
but things that interest them.
											And we talk about the world
flattens, being in this panel,
											and I am very optimistic —
whenever I think about blogs,
											I&#39;m like, &quot;We&#39;ve got to reach
all these people.&quot;
											Hundreds of millions
and billions of people.
											We&#39;re getting into China,
we want to be there,
											but there are so many people that
won&#39;t have the access to write a blog.
											But to see something
like the $100 computer is amazing,
											because blogging software is simple.
											We have a successful company
because of timing,
											and because of perseverance,
but it&#39;s simple stuff —
											it&#39;s not rocket science.
											And so, that&#39;s an amazing
thing to consider.
											So —
											the life record of a blog is something
that I find incredibly important.

											So you have these people aging,

to have, to be able to track this.
											I wish that I would have
this of my family.
											I know that one day my children
will be wondering —

or my great-grandchildren,
											if I ever have children —
											what I am going to —

											I am a blogger —
											that is an amazing thing for me,
											because it captures
a moment in time every day.
											I take a picture of myself —
I&#39;ve been doing this since last year —
											every single day.

											Only a couple of people read it.
											I don&#39;t write this for this audience;

insane if this was really public.
											About four people probably read it,

											I&#39;m probably going to get people
telling me I haven&#39;t updated.

go back to a day — to April 2005,
											and say, what was I doing this day?
											I look at it, I know exactly.

											And I remember instantly:
I am in Germany in this —
											I had to go for a one-day trip.
											I was sick, and I was in a hotel room,
											and I wanted not to be there.
											And so you see these things,
it&#39;s not just always smiling.
											Now I&#39;ve kind of evolved it,
so I have this look.
											If you look at my driver&#39;s license,
I have the same look,

											And the last story
I really want to tell is this story,
											because this is probably the one
that means the most to me
											in all of what I&#39;m doing.
											I&#39;ll probably get choked up,
because I tend to when I talk about this.
											So, this woman, her name was Emma,
											and she was a blogger
on our service, TypePad.
											And she was a beta tester,
so she was there right when we opened —
											you know, there was 100 people.
											And she wrote about her life
dealing with cancer.
											She was writing and writing,
and we all started reading it,
											because we had
so few blogs on the service,
											we could keep track of everyone.

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And she was writing one day,
											and then she disappeared for a little bit.
											And her sister came on, and she said
that Emma had passed away.
											And all of our support staff who had
talked to her were really emotional,
											and it was a very hard day at the company.
									</p>
								</div>

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And this was one of those
instances where I realized
											how much blogging
affects our relationship,
											and flattening this sort of world.
											That this woman is in England,
											and she lives — she lived — a life
											where she was talking
about what she was doing.
											But the big thing
that really influenced us was,
											her sister wrote to me, and she said —
											and she wrote on this blog —
											that writing her blog during
the last couple of months of her life
											was probably the best thing
that had happened to her,
											and being able to talk to people
and to share what was going on,
											and being able to write
and receive comments.
											And that was amazing,
											to be able to know
that we had empowered that,
											and that blogging was something
that she felt comfortable doing,
											and the idea that blogging
doesn&#39;t have to be scary,
											that we don&#39;t always have
to be attack of the blogs,
											that we can be people who are open,
and wanting to help and talk to people.
											That was an amazing thing.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And so I printed out and sent
a PDF of her blog to her family,
											and they passed it
out at her memorial service,
											and even in her obituary,
they mentioned her blog,
											because it was such
a big part of her life.
											And that&#39;s a huge thing.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So, this is her legacy,
											and I think that my call to action
to all of you is:
											think about blogs,
think about what they are,
											think about what you&#39;ve thought of them,
											and then actually do it,
											because it&#39;s something
that&#39;s really going to change our lives.
