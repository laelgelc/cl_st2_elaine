											I don&#39;t know about you, but I haven&#39;t quite figured out
											exactly what technology means in my life.
											I&#39;ve spent the past year thinking about what it really should be about.
											Should I be pro-technology? Should I embrace it full arms?
											Should I be wary? Like you, I&#39;m very tempted by the latest thing.
											But at the other hand, a couple of years ago
											I gave up all of my possessions,
											sold all my technology — except for a bicycle —
											and rode across 3,000 miles on the U.S. back roads under the power of my one body,
											fuelled mostly by Twinkies and junk food.

									<p>
											And I&#39;ve since then tried to keep technology
											at arm&#39;s length in many ways, so it doesn&#39;t master my life.
											At the same time, I run a website on cool tools,
											where I issue a daily obsession of the latest things in technology.
											So I&#39;m still perplexed about what the true meaning of technology is
											as it relates to humanity, as it relates to nature,
											as it relates to the spiritual.
											And I&#39;m not even sure we know what technology is.
											And one definition of technology is that which is first recorded.
											This is the first example of the modern use of technology that I can find.
											It was the suggested syllabus for dealing with
											the Applied Arts and Science at Cambridge University in 1829.

											Before that, obviously, technology didn&#39;t exist. But obviously it did.
											I like one of the definitions that Alan Kay has for technology.
											He says technology is anything that was invented after you were born.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So it sums up a lot of what we&#39;re talking about.
											Danny Hillis actually has an update on that —
											he says technology is anything that doesn&#39;t quite work yet.

									<p>
											Which also, I think, gets into a little bit of our current idea.
											But I was interested in another definition of technology.
											Something, again, that went back to something more fundamental.
											Something that was deeper. And as I struggled to understand that,
											I came up with a way of framing the question
											that seemed to work for me in my investigations.
											And I&#39;m, this morning, going to talk about this for the first time.
											So this is a very rough attempt to think out loud.
									</p>
								</div>

											The question that I came up with was this question:
											what does technology want? And by that, I don&#39;t mean,
											does it want chocolate or vanilla? By what it wants, I mean,
											what are its inherent trends and biases?
											What are its tendencies over time? One way to think about this is
											thinking about biological organisms, which we&#39;ve heard a lot about.
											And the trick that Richard Dawkins does, which is to say,
											to look at them as simply as genes, as vehicles for genes.
											So he&#39;s saying, what do genes want? The selfish gene.
											And I&#39;m applying a similar trick to say,
											what if we looked at the universe in our culture
											through the eyes of technology? What does technology want?
											Obviously, this in an incomplete question,
											just as looking at an organism as only a gene
											is an incomplete way of looking at it.
											But it&#39;s still very, very productive. So I&#39;m attempting to say,
											if we take technology&#39;s view of the world, what does it want?
											And I think once we ask that question
											we have to go back, actually, to life. Because obviously,
											if we keep extending the origins of technology far back,
											I think we come back to life at some point.

											So that&#39;s where I want to begin my little exploration, is in life.
											And like you heard from the previous speakers,
											we don&#39;t really know what life there is on Earth right now.
											We have really no idea.
											Craig Venter&#39;s tremendous and brilliant attempt
											to DNA sequence things in the ocean is great.
											Brian Farrell&#39;s work is all part of this agenda to try
											and actually discover all the species on Earth.
											And one of the things that we should do is just make a grid of the globe
											and randomly go and inspect all the places that the grid intersects,
											just to see what&#39;s on life. And if we did that
											with our little Martian probe, which we have not done on Earth,
											we would begin to see some incredible species.

											This is not on another planet. These are things
											that are hidden away on our planet.
											This is an ant that stores its colleagues&#39; honey in its abdomen.
											Each one of these organisms that we&#39;ve described — that you&#39;ve seen
											from Jamie and others, these magnificent things —
											what they&#39;re doing, each one of them,
											is they&#39;re hacking the rules of life.
											I can&#39;t think of a single general principle of biology
											that does not have an exception somewhere by some organism.
											Every single thing that we can think of —
											and if you heard Olivia&#39;s talk about the sexual habits,
											you&#39;ll realize that there isn&#39;t anything we can say that&#39;s true for all life,
											because every single one of them is hacking something about it.
											This is a solar-powered sea slug. It&#39;s a nudibranch
											that has incorporated chloroplast inside it to drive its energy.
											This is another version of that. This is a sea dragon,
											and the one on the bottom, the blue one, is a juvenile that has not yet
											swallowed the acid, has not yet taken in
											the brown-green algae pond scum into its body to give it energy.

											These are hacks, and if we looked at the general shape
											of the approaches to hacking life there are, current consensus,
											six kingdoms. Six different broad approaches: the plants,
											the animals, the fungi, the protests — the little things — the bacteria
											and the Archaea bacteria. The Archaeas.
											Those are the general approaches to life. That&#39;s one way to look at life on Earth today.

									<p>
											But a more interesting way,
											the current way to take the long view,
											is to look at it in an evolutionary perspective.
											And here we have a view of evolution where rather than having evolution
											go over the linear time, we have it coming out from the center.
											So in the center is the most primitive, and this is a genealogical chart
											of all life on earth. This is all the same six kingdoms.
											You see 4,000 representative species, and you can see where we are.
											But what I like about this is it shows that
											every living organism on Earth today is equally evolved.
											Those fungi and bacteria are as highly evolved as humans.
											They&#39;ve been around just as long and gone through
											just the same kind of trial and error to get here.
											But we see that each one of these is actually hacking,
											and has a different way of finding out how to do life.

									<p>
											And if we take the long-term trends of life, if we begin to say,
											what does evolution want? There&#39;s several things that we see.
											One of the things about evolution is that nowhere on Earth
											have we ever been where we don&#39;t find life.
											We find life at the bottom of every long-term,
											long-distance drilling core into the center of rock
											that we bring up — and there&#39;s bacteria in the pores of that rock.
											And wherever life is, it never retreats. It&#39;s ubiquitous and it wants to be more.
											More and more of the inert matter of the globe
											is being touched and animated by life.

									<p>
											The second thing is is we see diversity. We also see specialization.
											We see the movement from a general-purpose cell
											to the more specific and specialized.
											And we see a drift towards complexity that&#39;s very intuitive.
											And actually, we have current data that does show
											that there is an actual drift towards complexity over time.
											And the last thing, I bring back this nudibranch.
											One of the things we see about life is that it moves
											from the inner to increasing sociability. And by that it means
											that there is more and more of life whose entire environment is other life.
											Like those chloroplast cells —
											they&#39;re completely surrounded by other life.
											They never touch the inner matter. There is more and more co-evolution.
											And so the general, long-term trends of evolution
											are roughly these five: ubiquity, diversity, specialization,
											complexity and socialization. Now, I took that and said,
											OK, what are the long-term trends in technology?

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And again, my question is, what does technology want?
											And so, remarkably, I discovered
											that there&#39;s also a drift toward specialization.
											That we see there&#39;s a general hammer,
											and hammers become more and more specific over time.
											There&#39;s obviously diversity. Huge numbers of things.
											This is all the contents of a Japanese home.
											I actually had my daughter — gave her a tally counter,
											and I gave her an assignment last summer to go around
											and count the number of species of technology in our household.
											And it came up with 6,000 different species of products.
											I did some research and found out that the King of England, Henry VIII,
											had only about 7,000 items in his household.
											And he was the King of England,
											and that was the entire wealth of England at the time.
											So we&#39;re seeing huge numbers of diversity in the kinds of things.

											This is a scene from Star Wars where the 3PO comes out
											and he sees machines making machines. How depraved!
											Well, this is actually what we&#39;re headed towards: world machines.
											And the technology is only being thrown out by other technologies.
											Most machines will only ever be in contact with other technology
											and not non-technology, or even life.

									<p>
											And thirdly, the idea that machines are becoming biological and complex
											is at this point a cliche. And I&#39;m happy to say,
											I was partly responsible for that cliche
											that machines are becoming biological, but that&#39;s pretty evident.
											So the major trends in technology evolution actually
											are the same as in biological evolution. The same drives that we see
											towards ubiquity, towards diversity, towards socialization,
											towards complexity. That is maybe not a big surprise
											because if we map out, say, the evolution of armor,
											you can actually follow a sort of an evolutionary-type cladistic tree.
											I suggest that, in fact, technology is the seventh kingdom of life.
											That its operations and how it works is so similar
											that we can think of it as the seventh kingdom.
											And so it would be sort of approximately up there,
											coming out of the animal kingdom. And if we were to do that,
											we would find out — we could actually approach technology in this way.

											This is Niles Eldredge. He was the co-developer with Stephen Jay Gould
											of the theory of punctuated equilibrium.
											But as a sideline, he happens to collect cornets.
											He has one of the world&#39;s largest collections — about 500 of them.
											And he has decided to treat them as if they were trilobites, or snails,
											and to do a morphological analysis,
											and try to derive their genealogical history over time.
											This is his chart, which is not quite published yet.
											But the most interesting aspect about this
											is that if you look at those red lines at the bottom,

											that was no longer made. That does not happen in biology.
											When something is extinct, you can&#39;t have it as your parent.
											But that does happen in technology. And it turns out

											So I took the great big 1895 Montgomery Ward&#39;s catalog
											and I randomly went through it. And I took a page — not quite a random page —
											I took a page that was actually more difficult than others
											because lots of the pages are filled with things
											that are still being made. But I took this page
											and I said, how many of these things are still being made?
											And not antiques. I want to know how many of these things are still in production.
											And the answer is: all of them.
											All of them are still being produced. So you&#39;ve got corn shellers.
											I don&#39;t know who needs a corn sheller.
											Be it corn shellers — you&#39;ve got ploughs; you&#39;ve got fan mills;
											all these things — and these are not, again, antiques. These are —
											you can order these. You can go to the web and you can buy them now,
											brand-new made. So in a certain sense, technologies don&#39;t die.
											In fact, you can buy, for 50 bucks, a stone-age knife

											It&#39;s short, bone handle, 50 bucks. And in fact,
											what&#39;s important is that this information actually never died out.
											It&#39;s not just that it was resurrected. It&#39;s continued all along.

											Even when we try to get rid of a technology, it&#39;s actually very hard.
											So we&#39;ve all heard about the Amish giving up cars.
											We&#39;ve heard about the Japanese giving up guns.
											We&#39;ve heard about this and that. But I actually went back and
											took what I could find, the examples in history
											where there have been prohibitions against technology,
											and then I tried to find out when they came back in,
											because they always came back in. And it turns out that the time,
											the duration of when they were outlawed and prohibited,
											is decreasing over time. And that basically, you can delay technology,
											but you can&#39;t kill it. So this makes sense, because in a certain sense
											what culture is, is the accumulation of ideas.
											That&#39;s what it&#39;s for. It&#39;s so that ideas don&#39;t die out.
											And when we take that, we take this idea of what culture is doing
											and add it to what the long-term trajectory — again, in life&#39;s evolution —
											we find that each case — each of the major transitions in life —
											what they&#39;re really about is accelerating and changing

											So all these steps in evolution are increasing, basically,
											the evolution of evolvability.
											So what&#39;s happening over time in life is
											that the ways in which you generate these new ideas, these new hacks,
											are increasing. And the real tricks are ways
											in which you kind of explore the way of exploring.
											And then what we see in the singularity,
											that prophesized by Kurzweil and others —
											his idea that technology is accelerating evolution.
											It&#39;s accelerating the way in which we search for ideas.
											So if you have life hacking —
											life means hacking, the game of survival —
											then evolution is a way to extend the game by changing the rules of the game.
											And what technology is really about is better ways to evolve.
											That is what we call an &quot;infinite game.&quot;
											That&#39;s the definition of &quot;infinite game.&quot; A finite game is play to win,
											and an infinite game is played to keep playing.

											The origins of technology was not in 1829,
											but was actually at the beginning of the Big Bang,
											and at that moment the entire huge billions of stars in the universe
											were compressed. The entire universe was compressed into a little quantum dot,
											and it was so tight in there, there was no room for any difference at all.
											That&#39;s the definition. There was no temperature.
											There was no difference whatsoever. And at the Big Bang,
											what it expanded was the potential for difference.
											So as it expands and as things expand what we have
											is the potential for differences, diversity, options, choices,

											maybe we can bring it back and have it help us monitor life.
											Maybe in some ways
											the fact that what we&#39;re trying to do with technology is find a good home for it.
											It&#39;s a terrible thing to spray DDT on cotton fields,
											but it&#39;s a really good thing to use
											to eliminate millions of cases of death due to malaria in a small village.

											Our humanity is actually defined by technology.
											All the things that we think that we really like about humanity
											is being driven by technology. This is the infinite game.
											That&#39;s what we&#39;re talking about.
											You see, technology is a way to evolve the evolution.
											It&#39;s a way to explore possibilities and opportunities and create more.
											And it&#39;s actually a way of playing the game, of playing all the games.
											That&#39;s what technology wants.
											And so when I think about what technology wants,
											I think that it has to do with the fact that every person here — and I really believe this —
											every person here has an assignment. And your assignment is
											to spend your life discovering what your assignment is.
											That recursive nature is the infinite game.
											And if you play that well, you&#39;ll have other people involved,
											so even that game extends and continues even when you&#39;re gone.
											That is the infinite game. And what technology is
											is the medium in which we play that infinite game.
											And so I think that we should embrace technology
											because it is an essential part of our journey
											in finding out who we are.
