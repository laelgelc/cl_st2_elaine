											So my freshman year of college
											I signed up for an internship in the housing unit
											at Greater Boston Legal Services.
											Showed up the first day
											ready to make coffee and photocopies,
											but was paired with this righteous, deeply inspired attorney
											named Jeff Purcell,
											who thrust me onto the front lines
											from the very first day.
									</p>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And over the course of nine months
											I had the chance
											to have dozens of conversations
											with low-income families in Boston
											who would come in presenting with housing issues,
											but always had an underlying health issue.
											So I had a client who came in,
											about to be evicted because he hasn&#39;t paid his rent.
											But he hasn&#39;t paid his rent, of course,
											because he&#39;s paying for his HIV medication
											and just can&#39;t afford both.
											We had moms who would come in,
											daughter has asthma,
											wakes up covered in cockroaches every morning.
											And one of our litigation strategies
											was actually to send me into the home of these clients
											with these large glass bottles.
											And I would collect the cockroaches,
											hot glue-gun them to this poster board
											that we&#39;d bring to court for our cases.
											And we always won
											because the judges were just so grossed out.
											Far more effective, I have to say,
											than anything I later learned in law school.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											But over the course of these nine months,
											I grew frustrated with feeling
											like we were intervening too far downstream
											in the lives of our clients —
											that by the time they came to us,
											they were already in crisis.
											And at the end of my freshman year of college,
											I read an article about the work
											that Dr. Barry Zuckerman was doing
											as Chair of Pediatrics
											at Boston Medical Center.
											And his first hire was a legal services attorney
											to represent the patients.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So I called Barry,
											and with his blessing, in October 1995
											walked into the waiting room
											of the pediatrics clinic at Boston Medical Center.
											I&#39;ll never forget,
											the TVs played this endless reel of cartoons.
											And the exhaustion of mothers
											who had taken two, three, sometimes four buses
											to bring their child to the doctor
											was just palpable.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											The doctors, it seemed,
											never really had enough time for all the patients,
											try as they might.
											And over the course of six months,
											I would corner them in the hallway
											and ask them a sort of naive but fundamental question:
											&quot;If you had unlimited resources,
											what&#39;s the one thing you would give your patients?&quot;
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And I heard the same story again and again,
											a story we&#39;ve heard hundreds of times since then.
											They said, &quot;Every day we have patients that come into the clinic —
											child has an ear infection,
											I prescribe antibiotics.
											But the real issue is there&#39;s no food at home.
											The real issue
											is that child is living with 12 other people
											in a two-bedroom apartment.
											And I don&#39;t even ask about those issues
											because there&#39;s nothing I can do.
											I have 13 minutes with each patient.
											Patients are piling up in the clinic waiting room.
											I have no idea where the nearest food pantry is.
											And I don&#39;t even have any help.&quot;
											In that clinic, even today,
											there are two social workers
											for 24,000 pediatric patients,
											which is better than a lot of the clinics out there.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So Health Leads was born of these conversations —
											a simple model
											where doctors and nurses
											can prescribe nutritious food,
											heat in the winter
											and other basic resources for their patients
											the same way they prescribe medication.
											Patients then take their prescriptions
											to our desk in the clinic waiting room
											where we have a core of well-trained college student advocates
											who work side by side with these families
											to connect them out
											to the existing landscape of community resources.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So we began with a card table in the clinic waiting room —
											totally lemonade stand style.
											But today we have a thousand college student advocates
											who are working to connect nearly 9,000 patients and their families
											with the resources that they need to be healthy.

									<p>
											So 18 months ago
											I got this email that changed my life.
											And the email was from Dr. Jack Geiger,
											who had written to congratulate me on Health Leads
											and to share, as he said,
											a bit of historical context.
											In 1965 Dr. Geiger founded
											one of the first two community health centers in this country,
											in a brutally poor area in the Mississippi Delta.
											And so many of his patients came in
											presenting with malnutrition
											that be began prescribing food for them.
											And they would take these prescriptions to the local supermarket,
											which would fill them
											and then charge the pharmacy budget of the clinic.
											And when the Office of Economic Opportunity in Washington, D.C. —
											which was funding Geiger&#39;s clinic —
											found out about this,
											they were furious.
											And they sent this bureaucrat down
											to tell Geiger that he was expected to use their dollars
											for medical care —
											to which Geiger famously and logically responded,
											&quot;The last time I checked my textbooks,
											the specific therapy for malnutrition was food.&quot;
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

											(Laughter)

							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So when I got this email from Dr. Geiger,
											I knew I was supposed to be proud
											to be part of this history.
											But the truth is
											I was devastated.
											Here we are,
											45 years after Geiger has prescribed food for his patients,
											and I have doctors telling me,
											&quot;On those issues, we practice a &#39;don&#39;t ask, don&#39;t tell&#39; policy.&quot;
											Forty-five years after Geiger,
											Health Leads has to reinvent
											the prescription for basic resources.
											So I have spent hours upon hours
											trying to make sense of this weird Groundhog Day.
											How is it that if for decades
											we had a pretty straightforward tool for keeping patients,
											and especially low-income patients, healthy,
											that we didn&#39;t use it?
											If we know what it takes to have a healthcare system
											rather than a sick-care system,
											why don&#39;t we just do it?
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											These questions, in my mind,
											are not hard because the answers are complicated,
											they are hard because they require that we be honest with ourselves.
											My belief is that it&#39;s almost too painful
											to articulate our aspirations for our healthcare system,
											or even admit that we have any at all.
											Because if we did,
											they would be so removed
											from our current reality.
											But that doesn&#39;t change my belief
											that all of us, deep inside,
											here in this room and across this country,
											share a similar set of desires.
											That if we are honest with ourselves
											and listen quietly,
											that we all harbor
											one fiercely held aspiration for our healthcare:
											that it keep us healthy.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											This aspiration that our healthcare keep us healthy
											is an enormously powerful one.
											And the way I think about this
											is that healthcare is like any other system.
											It&#39;s just a set of choices that people make.
											What if we decided
											to make a different set of choices?
											What if we decided to take all the parts of healthcare
											that have drifted away from us
											and stand firm and say, &quot;No.
											These things are ours.
											They will be used for our purposes.
											They will be used to realize
											our aspiration&quot;?
											What if everything we needed
											to realize our aspiration for healthcare
											was right there in front of us
											just waiting to be claimed?
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So that&#39;s where Health Leads began.
											We started with the prescription pad —
											a very ordinary piece of paper —
											and we asked, not what do patients need to get healthy —
											antibiotics, an inhaler, medication —
											but what do patients need to be healthy,
											to not get sick in the first place?
											And we chose to use the prescription
											for that purpose.
											So just a few miles from here
											at Children&#39;s National Medical Center,
											when patients come into the doctor&#39;s office,
											they&#39;re asked a few questions.
											They&#39;re asked, &quot;Are you running out of food at the end of the month?
											Do you have safe housing?&quot;
											And when the doctor begins the visit,
											she knows height, weight, is there food at home,
											is the family living in a shelter.
											And that not only leads to a better set of clinical choices,
											but the doctor can also prescribe those resources for the patient,
											using Health Leads like any other sub-specialty referral.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											The problem is,
											once you get a taste of what it&#39;s like
											to realize your aspiration for healthcare,
											you want more.
											So we thought,
											if we can get individual doctors
											to prescribe these basic resources for their patients,
											could we get an entire healthcare system
											to shift its presumption?
											And we gave it a shot.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So now at Harlem Hospital Center
											when patients come in with an elevated body mass index,
											the electronic medical record
											automatically generates a prescription for Health Leads.
											And our volunteers can then work with them
											to connect patients to healthy food and excercise programs
											in their communities.
											We&#39;ve created a presumption
											that if you&#39;re a patient at that hospital
											with an elevated BMI,
											the four walls of the doctor&#39;s office
											probably aren&#39;t going to give you everything
											you need to be healthy.
											You need more.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So on the one hand,
											this is just a basic recoding
											of the electronic medical record.
											And on the other hand,
											it&#39;s a radical transformation
											of the electronic medical record
											from a static repository of diagnostic information
											to a health promotion tool.
											In the private sector,
											when you squeeze that kind of additional value
											out of a fixed-cost investment,
											it&#39;s called a billion-dollar company.
											But in my world,
											it&#39;s called reduced obesity and diabetes.
											It&#39;s called healthcare —
											a system where doctors can prescribe solutions
											to improve health,
											not just manage disease.

											Same thing in the clinic waiting room.
											So every day in this country
											three million patients
											pass through about 150,000 clinic waiting rooms in this country.
											And what do they do when they&#39;re there?
											They sit, they watch the goldfish in the fish tank,
											they read extremely old copies
											of Good Housekeeping magazine.
											But mostly we all just sit there forever, waiting.
											How did we get here
											where we devote hundreds of acres and thousands of hours
											to waiting?
											What if we had a waiting room
											where you don&#39;t just sit when you&#39;re sick,
											but where you go to get healthy.
											If airports can become shopping malls
											and McDonald&#39;s can become playgrounds,
											surely we can reinvent the clinic waiting room.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And that&#39;s what Health Leads has tried to do,
											to reclaim that real estate and that time
											and to use it as a gateway
											to connect patients
											to the resources they need to be healthy.
											So it&#39;s a brutal winter in the Northeast,
											your kid has asthma, your heat just got turned off,
											and of course you&#39;re in the waiting room of the ER,
											because the cold air triggered your child&#39;s asthma.
											But what if instead of waiting for hours anxiously,
											the waiting room became the place
											where Health Leads turned your heat back on?

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And of course all of this requires
											a broader workforce.
											But if we&#39;re creative, we already have that too.
											We know that our doctors and nurses
											and even social workers
											aren&#39;t enough,
											that the ticking minutes of health care
											are too constraining.
											Health just takes more time.
											It requires a non-clinical army
											of community health workers and case managers

											Now lest you think it improbable
											that a college volunteer
											can make this kind of commitment,
											I have two words for you:
											March Madness.
											The average NCAA Division I men&#39;s basketball player
											dedicates 39 hours a week to his sport.
											Now we may think that&#39;s good or bad,
											but in either case it&#39;s real.
											And Health Leads is based on the presumption
											that for too long
											we have asked too little of our college students
											when it comes to real impact in vulnerable communities.
											College sports teams say,
											&quot;We&#39;re going to take dozens of hours
											at some field across campus at some ungodly hour of the morning
											and we&#39;re going to measure your performance, and your team&#39;s performance,
											and if you don&#39;t measure up or you don&#39;t show up,
											we&#39;re going to cut you off the team.
											But we&#39;ll make huge investments
