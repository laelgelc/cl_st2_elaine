<title>Halla Tómasdóttir and Bryn Freedman: The crisis of leadership -- and a new way forward | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: What should modern leadership look like? Entrepreneur and former Icelandic presidential candidate Halla Tómasdóttir thinks global leaders need to change their ways -- or risk becoming irrelevant. In a conversation with curator Bryn Freedman, she shows how anybody can step up and make a difference, even if you don&#39;t yet have power. &quot;There&#39;s a leader inside every single one of us,&quot; she says, &quot;and our most important work in life is to release that leader.&quot;" />

<meta content='The crisis of leadership — and a new way forward' itemprop='name'>
<meta content='What should modern leadership look like? Entrepreneur and former Icelandic presidential candidate Halla Tómasdóttir thinks global leaders need to change their ways — or risk becoming irrelevant. In a conversation with curator Bryn Freedman, she shows how anybody can step up and make a difference, even if you don&#x0027;t yet have power. "There&#x0027;s a leader inside every single one of us," she says, "and our most important work in life is to release that leader."' itemprop='description'>

											Bryn Freedman: So you keep
talking about leadership
											as a real crisis of conformity.
											Can you explain to us
what you mean by that?
											What do you see as a crisis of conformity?
											Halla Tómasdóttir:
I think it&#39;s a crisis of conformity
											when we continue to do business
and lead in the way we always have,
											yet the evidence is overwhelming
											that the world needs us
to change our ways.
											So let&#39;s look a little bit
at that evidence.
											Science has told us
that we&#39;re facing a climate crisis,
											yet 40 percent of board directors
											don&#39;t think climate belongs
in the boardroom.
											And we have kids marching
in the streets now,
											asking us to be accountable
for their future.
											We have a crisis of inequality.
											We have Yellow Jackets
not just in the streets of France,
											but all over the world,
											and yet we continue to see examples
											of businesses and other leaders
fueling that anger.

											HT: I definitely think
this is not sustainable.
											And the reason why it&#39;s so difficult
											for us to deal with these complicated
crises that are interrelated
											is that we are at the lowest levels
of trust we&#39;ve ever been at.
											In the UK, three percent of people
trust their government
											to solve the Brexit crisis,
											and that was in December.
											I think it&#39;s probably gone
down since then.

											HT: We need courageous leaders,
											yet they have to be humble.
											And they have to be guided
by a moral compass,
											and the moral compass is the combination
of having a social purpose —
											you can&#39;t have your license
to operate anymore
											without a purpose
that contributes to society,
											but what, to me, has been missing
from that dialogue is a set of principles.
											We cannot just define why we exist,
											we have to define
how we&#39;re going to do business
											and how we&#39;re going to lead.
											And to us, that has to be
to solve these imminent crises:
											the climate crisis,
											the crisis of inequality
											and the crisis of trust.
											So at The B Team,
											we embrace sustainability, equality
and accountability as our principles.

to be around for the 21st century
											really needs to start thinking
courageously and holistically

to be part of the solution

											HT: Fortunately, we have
some great leaders out there.
											And just to give one example,
											Emmanuel Faber, who&#39;s one of the newest
members of The B Team,
											he&#39;s the CEO of Danone,
											the world&#39;s largest yogurt-maker
and major food company —
											a real global company.
											He&#39;s so committed to sustainability
											that he&#39;s not only changing the ways
of his own business,
											but his entire supply chain.
											He&#39;s so committed to equality
that when he took on as CEO
											and he said gender balance matters,
											he created a gender-balanced
executive team
											and gave men and women
equal maternity and paternity leave.
											He&#39;s so committed to accountability
											that he turned his US operations
into a B Corporation.
											Now many of you may not know what that is,
											but that&#39;s a company
that holds itself responsible
											for not just profit but its impact
on people and the planet,
											and transparently reports
on their performance on all of that.
											It&#39;s the largest B Corp in the world.
											So to me, that&#39;s holistic,
courageous leadership,
											and it&#39;s really the vision
we all need to hold.

											BF: Is this &quot;Back to the Future&quot;?
											I mean, I wonder,
when I think about companies —
											Anheuser-Busch comes to mind in America —
											a 100-year-old company
that invested in its community,
											that gave a living wage
											before it ended up, you know,
losing and getting sold.
											Are we really looking now for companies
that are global and community citizens,

									<p>
											HT: Well, you can do this for the reason
that it&#39;s risky, actually,
											to continue without doing
the right thing now.
											You can&#39;t attract the right talent,
											you can&#39;t attract customers
											and increasingly,
you won&#39;t be able to attract capital.
											You might do it for risk reasons,
											you might do it for business
opportunity reasons,
											because this is where the growth is,
											which is why many leaders
are doing the right thing.
											But at the end of the day,
											we need to ask ourselves:
											&quot;Who are we holding
ourselves accountable for?&quot;
											And if that isn&#39;t the next generation,
											I don&#39;t know who.

											So I want to just make very clear,
											because we tend to think about leadership
											as only those who sit
in positions of power.
											To me, leadership is not at all like that.

								</div>

									<p>
											There&#39;s a leader inside
every single one of us,
											and our most important work in life
is to release that leader.
											And I think one of the greatest
global examples we have
											of someone who didn&#39;t —
											no one gave her power —
											is the 16-year-old girl
called Greta Thunberg.
											She&#39;s from Sweden,
											and a few years ago, she really became —
											she has Asperger&#39;s,
											and she became passionate
about our climate crisis —
											learned everything about it.
											And faced with the evidence,
											she just felt so disappointed
in her leadership
											that she started striking
in front of the Swedish parliament.
											And now she has started a global movement,
											and hundreds and thousands
of school kids are out in the streets
											asking us to hold ourselves
accountable for their future.
											No one gave her that authority,
											and she now speaks to the leaders
of the world, heads of state,
											and really is impacting the world.

											So I really think that when we think
about leadership today,
											it can&#39;t be defined
to those in positions of power
											though they have disproportionately
greater responsibility.
											But all of us need to think about,
											&quot;What am I doing?&quot;
											&quot;How am I contributing?&quot;
											And we need to release that leader inside
											and actually start making
the positive impact
											this world is calling for right now.

hierarchical leadership.
											I mean, I understand what you&#39;re saying —
											it&#39;s nice to release the leader inside —

											What can companies do

											HT: Well, I&#39;m a big believer
and I&#39;ve long been passionate
											about closing the gender gap,
											and I really believe gender-balanced
leadership is the way to go
											in order to embrace a leadership style
that has been shown to be more powerful,
											and that&#39;s when both men and women embrace
											both masculine and feminine values.
											It actually is proven in research
											that that&#39;s the most
effective leadership style.
											But I&#39;m increasingly now thinking
about how we close the generational gap,
											because look at these young children
in the streets around the world —
											they&#39;re asking us to lead.
											Kofi Annan used to say,
&quot;You&#39;re never too young to lead.&quot;
											And then he would add,
											&quot;Or too old to learn.&quot;
											And I think we have now entered this era
											where we need the wisdom
of those with experience,
											but we need the digital natives
of the young generation
											to co-mentor or to mentor us
just as much as we can help
											with wisdom from the older people.
											So it&#39;s a new reality,
											and these old, sort of hierarchical
ways to think about things,
											they&#39;re increasingly coming
under pressure in this reality.

is our cancer in leadership.
											That&#39;s when leaders
think they know it all,
											can do it all, have all the answers
											and don&#39;t think they need
to surround themselves
											with people who will make them better,
											which to me would, in some cases,
be more women and younger people
											and people who are diverse
and have different opinions in general.
											Hubris syndrome is so present
in leadership still,

the most infamous financial meltdown

to learn or to wake up.

one or the other.
											We do have to transform the way we lead —

											we really do have to transform that,

at the top won&#39;t listen,

and the employer,

may be the most powerful way

											So the way I see gender,
it is a spectrum —
											you know, men also have gender.
											We sometimes forget about that.

											We sometimes forget about that.
											And I actually played a very masculine
woman early in my career,
											because those were the rules of the game.
											And I achieved some success with it,
											but fortunately, I got to a place
											where I started embracing
my feminine side as well.
											But I would still say
that the best leaders embrace both,
											both women and men.
											But I see gender, also,
											as one of the most powerful levers
to shift values in culture.
											So the reason I&#39;m so passionate
about women in leadership
											and believe that balance is needed
											is because right now, our definition
of success is incredibly masculine.
											It&#39;s about financial profit alone
or economic growth alone,
											and we all know that we need
more than money.
											I mean, we need wellness:
											well-being of people,
											and there is no future
beyond the well-being of our planet.
											So I think gender may very well be
one of the most powerful levers
											to help all of us shift
our economic and social systems
											to be more welcoming.

											And the answer to your last part —
											it&#39;s so complicated, but let me try
to give you a short one.
											I believe that the way talent
and consumption is shifting
											is going to increasingly get companies
											to look at adding difference
into their leadership,
											because sameness is not working —
