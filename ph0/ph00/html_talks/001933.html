<title>Elizabeth Lev: The unheard story of the Sistine Chapel | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: The Sistine Chapel is one of the most iconic buildings on earth -- but there&#39;s a lot you probably don&#39;t know about it. In this tour-de-force talk, art historian Elizabeth Lev guides us across the famous building&#39;s ceiling and Michelangelo&#39;s vital depiction of traditional stories, showing how the painter reached beyond the religious iconography of the time to chart new artistic waters. Five hundred years after the artist painted it, says Lev, the Sistine Chapel forces us to look around as if it were a mirror and ask, &quot;Who am I, and what role do I play in this great theater of life?&quot;" />

<meta content='The Sistine Chapel is one of the most iconic buildings on earth — but there&#x0027;s a lot you probably don&#x0027;t know about it. In this tour-de-force talk, art historian Elizabeth Lev guides us across the famous building&#x0027;s ceiling and Michelangelo&#x0027;s vital depiction of traditional stories, showing how the painter reached beyond the religious iconography of the time to chart new artistic waters. Five hundred years after the artist painted it, says Lev, the Sistine Chapel forces us to look around as if it were a mirror and ask, "Who am I, and what role do I play in this great theater of life?"' itemprop='description'>

											Imagine you&#39;re in Rome,

to the Vatican Museums.
											And you&#39;ve been shuffling
down long corridors,
											past statues, frescoes,
lots and lots of stuff.
											You&#39;re heading towards the Sistine Chapel.

											Well, curtains up on the Sistine Chapel.
											And I mean literally, you&#39;re surrounded
by painted curtains,
											the original decoration of this chapel.
											Churches used tapestries not just
to keep out cold during long masses,
											but as a way to represent
the great theater of life.
											The human drama in which each one of us
plays a part is a great story,
											a story that encompasses the whole world

											Now, this building started out
as a space for a small group
											of wealthy, educated Christian priests.
											They prayed there.
They elected their pope there.
											Five hundred years ago,
											it was the ultimate
ecclesiastical man cave.
											So, you may ask, how can it be
that today it attracts and delights
											five million people a year,
											from all different backgrounds?
											Because in that compressed space,
there was a creative explosion,
											ignited by the electric excitement
of new geopolitical frontiers,
											which set on fire the ancient
missionary tradition of the Church
											and produced one of the greatest
works of art in history.

											Now, this development took place
as a great evolution,
											moving from the beginning of a few elite,
											and eventually able to speak
to audiences of people
											that come from all over the world.
											This evolution took place in three stages,
											each one linked
to a historical circumstance.
											The first one was rather limited in scope.
											It reflected the rather
parochial perspective.
											The second one took place after
worldviews were dramatically altered
											after Columbus&#39;s historical voyage;
											and the third,
											when the Age of Discovery
was well under way
											and the Church rose to the challenge
											of going global.

											The original decoration of this church
reflected a smaller world.
											There were busy scenes
											that told the stories of the lives
of Jesus and Moses,
											reflecting the development
of the Jewish and Christian people.
											The man who commissioned this,
Pope Sixtus IV,
											assembled a dream team of Florentine art,
											including men like Sandro Botticelli
											and the man who would become
Michelangelo&#39;s future painting teacher,
											Ghirlandaio.
											These men, they blanketed the walls
with a frieze of pure color,
											and in these stories you&#39;ll notice
familiar landscapes,
											the artists using Roman monuments
or a Tuscan landscape
											to render a faraway story,
something much more familiar.
											With the addition of images
of the Pope&#39;s friends and family,
											this was a perfect decoration
for a small court
											limited to the European continent.
											But in 1492, the New World was discovered,
											horizons were expanding,
											and this little 133 by 46-foot
microcosm had to expand as well.
											And it did,
											thanks to a creative genius,
											a visionary and an awesome story.

											Now, the creative genius
was Michelangelo Buonarroti,
											33 years old when he was tapped
to decorate 12,000 square feet of ceiling,
											and the deck was stacked against him —
											he had trained in painting
but had left to pursue sculpture.
											There were angry patrons in Florence
because he had left a stack
											of incomplete commissions,
											lured to Rome by the prospect
of a great sculptural project,
											and that project had fallen through.
											And he had been left with a commission
to paint 12 apostles
											against a decorative background
in the Sistine Chapel ceiling,
											which would look like
every other ceiling in Italy.

											But genius rose to the challenge.
											In an age when a man dared
to sail across the Atlantic Ocean,
											Michelangelo dared to chart
new artistic waters.
											He, too, would tell a story —
											no Apostles — but a story
of great beginnings,
											the story of Genesis.

											Not really an easy sell,
stories on a ceiling.
											How would you be able to read
a busy scene from 62 feet below?
											The painting technique that had been
handed on for 200 years

for this kind of a narrative.

											But Michelangelo wasn&#39;t really a painter,
											and so he played to his strengths.
											Instead of being accustomed
to filling space with busyness,
											he took a hammer and chisel
and hacked away at a piece of marble
											to reveal the figure within.
											Michelangelo was an essentialist;
											he would tell his story
in massive, dynamic bodies.

											This plan was embraced
by the larger-than-life Pope Julius II,
											a man who was unafraid
of Michelangelo&#39;s brazen genius.
											He was nephew to Pope Sixtus IV,
											and he had been steeped in art
for 30 years and he knew its power.
											And history has handed down the moniker
of the Warrior Pope,
											but this man&#39;s legacy to the Vatican —
it wasn&#39;t fortresses and artillery,
											it was art.
											He left us the Raphael Rooms,
the Sistine Chapel.
											He left St. Peter&#39;s Basilica
											as well as an extraordinary collection
of Greco-Roman sculptures —
											decidedly un-Christian works
that would become the seedbed
											of the world&#39;s first modern museum,
the Vatican Museums.
											Julius was a man
											who envisioned a Vatican
that would be eternally relevant
											through grandeur and through beauty,
											and he was right.
											The encounter between these two giants,
Michelangelo and Julius II,
											that&#39;s what gave us the Sistine Chapel.
											Michelangelo was so committed
to this project,
											that he succeeded in getting the job done
in three and a half years,
											using a skeleton crew and spending
most of the time, hours on end,
											reaching up above his head
to paint the stories on the ceiling.

											So let&#39;s look at this ceiling
											and see storytelling gone global.
											No more familiar artistic references
to the world around you.
											There&#39;s just space
and structure and energy;
											a monumental painted framework
which opens onto nine panels,
											more driven by sculptural form
than painterly color.
											And we stand in the far end
by the entrance,
											far from the altar and from the gated
enclosure intended for the clergy
											and we peer into the distance,
looking for a beginning.
											And whether in scientific inquiry
or in biblical tradition,
											we think in terms of a primal spark.
											Michelangelo gave us an initial energy
											when he gave us the separation
of light and dark,
											a churning figure blurry in the distance,
											compressed into a tight space.
											The next figure looms larger,
											and you see a figure hurtling
from one side to the next.
											He leaves in his wake
the sun, the moon, vegetation.
											Michelangelo didn&#39;t focus
on the stuff that was being created,
											unlike all the other artists.
											He focused on the act of creation.

									<p>
											And then the movement stops,
like a caesura in poetry
											and the creator hovers.
											So what&#39;s he doing?
											Is he creating land? Is he creating sea?
											Or is he looking back over his handiwork,
the universe and his treasures,
											just like Michelangelo must have,
											looking back over his work in the ceiling

											So now the scene is set,
											and you get to the culmination
of creation, which is man.
											Adam leaps to the eye, a light figure
against a dark background.
											But looking closer,
											that leg is pretty languid on the ground,
											the arm is heavy on the knee.
											Adam lacks that interior spark
											that will impel him to greatness.
											That spark is about to be conferred
by the creator in that finger,
											which is one millimeter
from the hand of Adam.
											It puts us at the edge of our seats,
											because we&#39;re one moment
from that contact,
											through which that man
will discover his purpose,
											leap up and take his place
at the pinnacle of creation.

											And then Michelangelo threw a curveball.
											Who is in that other arm?
											Eve, first woman.
											No, she&#39;s not an afterthought.
She&#39;s part of the plan.
											She&#39;s always been in his mind.
											Look at her, so intimate with God
that her hand curls around his arm.
											And for me, an American art historian
from the 21st century,
											this was the moment
that the painting spoke to me.
											Because I realized that this
representation of the human drama
											was always about men and women —
											so much so, that the dead center,
the heart of the ceiling,
											is the creation of woman, not Adam.
											And the fact is, that when you see them
together in the Garden of Eden,
											they fall together
											and together their proud posture
turns into folded shame.

											You are at critical juncture
now in the ceiling.
											You are exactly at the point
where you and I can go
											no further into the church.
											The gated enclosure keeps us
out of the inner sanctum,
											and we are cast out
much like Adam and Eve.
											The remaining scenes in the ceiling,
											they mirror the crowded chaos
of the world around us.
											You have Noah and his Ark and the flood.
											You have Noah. He&#39;s making a sacrifice
and a covenant with God.
											Maybe he&#39;s the savior.
											Oh, but no, Noah is the one
who grew grapes, invented wine,
											got drunk and passed out
naked in his barn.
											It is a curious way to design the ceiling,
											now starting out with God creating life,
											ending up with some guy
blind drunk in a barn.
											And so, compared with Adam,
											you might think Michelangelo
is making fun of us.

											All of this brings us to the yawning
archway of the altar wall,
											where we see Michelangelo&#39;s Last Judgment,
											painted in 1534 after the world
had changed again.
											The Reformation had splintered the Church,
											the Ottoman Empire had made
Islam a household word
											and Magellan had found a route
into the Pacific Ocean.
											How is a 59-year-old artist who has never
been any further than Venice
											going to speak to this new world?
											Michelangelo chose to paint destiny,
											that universal desire,
											common to all of us,
											to leave a legacy of excellence.
											Told in terms of the Christian vision
of the Last Judgment,
											the end of the world,
											Michelangelo gave you a series of figures
											who are wearing these
strikingly beautiful bodies.
											They have no more covers,
no more portraits
											except for a couple.
											It&#39;s a composition only out of bodies,
											391, no two alike,
											unique like each and every one of us.
											They start in the lower corner,
breaking away from the ground,
											struggling and trying to rise.
											Those who have risen
reach back to help others,
											and in one amazing vignette,
											you have a black man and a white man
pulled up together
											in an incredible vision of human unity
											in this new world.
											The lion&#39;s share of the space
goes to the winner&#39;s circle.
											There you find men and women
completely nude like athletes.
											They are the ones
who have overcome adversity,
											and Michelangelo&#39;s vision
of people who combat adversity,
											overcome obstacles —
											they&#39;re just like athletes.
											So you have men and women
flexing and posing
											in this extraordinary spotlight.
											Presiding over this assembly is Jesus,
											first a suffering man on the cross,
											now a glorious ruler in Heaven.
											And as Michelangelo
proved in his painting,
											hardship, setbacks and obstacles,
											they don&#39;t limit excellence,
they forge it.

											Now, this does lead us to one odd thing.
											This is the Pope&#39;s private chapel,
											and the best way you can describe that
is indeed a stew of nudes.
											But Michelangelo was trying to use
only the best artistic language,
											the most universal artistic language
he could think of:
											that of the human body.
											And so instead of the way of showing
virtue such as fortitude or self-mastery,
											he borrowed from Julius II&#39;s
wonderful collection of sculptures
											in order to show inner strength
as external power.

											Now, one contemporary did write
											that the chapel was too beautiful
to not cause controversy.
											And so it did.
											Michelangelo soon found
that thanks to the printing press,
											complaints about the nudity
spread all over the place,
											and soon his masterpiece of human drama
was labeled pornography,
											at which point he added
two more portraits,
											one of the man who criticized him,
a papal courtier,
											and the other one of himself
as a dried up husk, no athlete,
											in the hands of a long-suffering martyr.
											The year he died he saw
several of these figures covered over,
											a triumph for trivial distractions
over his great exhortation to glory.

to look around as if it were a mirror.

											Am I one of the crowd?

											Am I the athlete?
											And as we leave this haven

											Elizabeth Lev: The effect
of the Last Judgment was enormous.
											The printing press made sure
that everybody saw it.
											And so, this wasn&#39;t something
that happened within a couple of weeks.
											It was something that happened
over the space of 20 years
											of editorials and complaints,
											saying to the Church,
											&quot;You can&#39;t possibly tell us
how to live our lives.
											Did you notice you have
pornography in the Pope&#39;s chapel?&quot;
											And so after complaints and insistence

											it was finally the year
that Michelangelo died
