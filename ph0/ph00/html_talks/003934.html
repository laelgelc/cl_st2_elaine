											Do we live in a borderless world?
											Before you answer that, have a look at this map.
											Contemporary political map shows
											that we have over 200 countries in the world today.
											That&#39;s probably more than at any time in centuries.
											Now, many of you will object.
											For you this would be a more appropriate map.
											You could call it TEDistan.
											In TEDistan, there are no borders,
											just connected spaces and unconnected spaces.
											Most of you probably reside in one of the 40 dots
											on this screen, of the many more
											that represent 90 percent of the world economy.

									<p>
											But let&#39;s talk about the 90 percent of the world population
											that will never leave the place in which they were born.
											For them, nations, countries, boundaries, borders still matter a great deal,
											and often violently.
											Now here at TED, we&#39;re solving some of the great
											riddles of science and mysteries of the universe.
											Well here is a fundamental problem we have not solved:
											our basic political geography.
											How do we distribute ourselves around the world?

											Now this is important, because border conflicts
											justify so much of the world&#39;s military-industrial complex.
											Border conflicts can derail
											so much of the progress that we hope to achieve here.
											So I think we need a deeper understanding
											of how people, money, power,
											religion, culture, technology
											interact to change the map of the world.

											So we&#39;re going to look at some maps of the past,
											the present and some maps you haven&#39;t seen
											in order to get a sense of where things are going.
											Let&#39;s start with the world of 1945.
											1945 there were just 100 countries in the world.
											After World War II, Europe was devastated,
											but still held large overseas colonies:
											French West Africa, British East Africa, South Asia, and so forth.
											Then over the late &#39;40s,
											&#39;50s, &#39;60s, &#39;70s and &#39;80s,
											waves of decolonization took place.
											Over 50 new countries were born.
											You can see that Africa has been fragmented.
											India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, South East Asian nations created.
											Then came the end of the Cold War.
											The end of the Cold War and the disintegration of the Soviet Union.
											You had the creation of new states in Eastern Europe,
											the former Yugoslav republics and the Balkans,
											and the &#39;stans of central Asia.
									</p>
								</div>

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Today we have 200 countries in the world.
											The entire planet is covered
											by sovereign, independent nation-states.
											Does that mean that someone&#39;s gain has to be someone else&#39;s loss?
											Let&#39;s zoom in on one of the most strategic areas of the world,
											Eastern Eurasia.
											As you can see on this map,
											Russia is still the largest country in the world.
											And as you know, China is the most populous.
											And they share a lengthy land border.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											What you don&#39;t see on this map
											is that most of Russia&#39;s 150 million people
											are concentrated in its western provinces
											and areas that are close to Europe.
											And only 30 million people are in its eastern areas.
											In fact, the World Bank predicts
											that Russia&#39;s population is declining
											towards about 120 million people
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And there is another thing that you don&#39;t see on this map.
											Stalin, Khrushchev and other Soviet leaders
											forced Russians out to the far east
											to be in gulags, labor camps,
											nuclear cities, whatever the case was.
											But as oil prices rose,
											Russian governments have invested in infrastructure
											to unite the country, east and west.
											But nothing has more perversely impacted
											Russia&#39;s demographic distribution,
											because the people in the east, who never wanted to be there anyway,
											have gotten on those trains and roads
											and gone back to the west.
											As a result, in the Russian far east today,
											which is twice the size of India,
											you have exactly six million Russians.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So let&#39;s get a sense of what is happening in this part of the world.
											We can start with Mongolia, or as some call it, Mine-golia.
											Why do they call it that?
											Because in Mine-golia, Chinese firms operate
											and own most of the mines — copper, zinc, gold —
											and they truck the resources south and east into mainland China.
											China isn&#39;t conquering Mongolia.
											It&#39;s buying it.
											Colonies were once conquered. Today countries are bought.

								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So let&#39;s apply this principle to Siberia.
											Siberia most of you probably think of
											as a cold, desolate, unlivable place.
											But in fact, with global warming and rising temperatures,
											all of a sudden you have vast wheat fields
											and agribusiness, and grain being produced in Siberia.
											But who is it going to feed?
											Well, just on the other side of the Amo River,
											in the Heilongjiang and Harbin provinces of China,
											you have over 100 million people.
											That&#39;s larger than the entire population of Russia.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Every single year, for at least a decade or more,
											[60,000] of them have been voting with their feet,
											crossing, moving north and inhabiting this desolate terrain.
											They set up their own bazaars and medical clinics.
											They&#39;ve taken over the timber industry
											and been shipping the lumber east, back into China.
											Again, like Mongolia,
											China isn&#39;t conquering Russia. It&#39;s just leasing it.
											That&#39;s what I call globalization Chinese style.

											Now maybe this is what the map of the region
											might look like in 10 to 20 years.
											But hold on. This map is 700 years old.
											This is the map of the Yuan Dynasty,
											led by Kublai Khan, the grandson of Genghis Khan.
											So history doesn&#39;t necessarily repeat itself,
											but it does rhyme.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											This is just to give you a taste of what&#39;s happening in this part of the world.
											Again, globalization Chinese style.
											Because globalization opens up all kinds of ways for us to
											undermine and change the way we think about political geography.
											So, the history of East Asia in fact,
											people don&#39;t think about nations and borders.
											They think more in terms of empires and hierarchies,
											usually Chinese or Japanese.

								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Well it&#39;s China&#39;s turn again.
											So let&#39;s look at how China is re-establishing
											that hierarchy in the far East.
											It starts with the global hubs.
											Remember the 40 dots on the nighttime map
											that show the hubs of the global economy?
											East Asia today has more of those global hubs
											than any other region in the world.
											Tokyo, Seoul, Beijing, Shanghai,
											Hong Kong, Singapore and Sidney.
											These are the filters and funnels of global capital.
											Trillions of dollars a year are being brought into the region,
											so much of it being invested into China.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Then there is trade.
											These vectors and arrows represent ever stronger
											trade relationships that China has
											with every country in the region.
											Specifically, it targets Japan
											and Korea and Australia,
											countries that are strong allies of the United States.
											Australia, for example, is heavily dependent
											on exporting iron ore and natural gas to China.
											For poorer countries, China reduces tariffs
											so that Laos and Cambodia can sell their goods more cheaply
											and become dependent on exporting to China as well.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And now many of you have been reading in the news
											how people are looking to China
											to lead the rebound, the economic rebound, not just in Asia, but potentially for the world.
											The Asian free trade zone, almost free trade zone, that&#39;s emerging
											now has a greater trade volume than trade across the Pacific.
											So China is becoming the anchor of the economy in the region.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Another pillar of this strategy is diplomacy.
											China has signed military agreements with many countries in the region.
											It has become the hub of diplomatic institutions
											such as the East Asian Community.
											Some of these organizations don&#39;t even have
											the United States as a member.
											There is a treaty of nonaggression between countries,
											such that if there were a conflict between China and the United States,
											most countries vow to just sit it out,
											including American allies like Korea and Australia.
									</p>

							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Another pillar of the strategy,
											like Russia, is demographic.
											China exports business people, nannies, students,
											teachers to teach Chinese around the region,
											to intermarry and to occupy ever greater
											commanding heights of the economies.
											Already ethnic Chinese people
											in Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia
											are the real key factors and drivers
											in the economies there.
											Chinese pride is resurgent in the region
											as a result.
											Singapore, for example, used to ban Chinese language education.
											Now it encourages it.

									<p>
											If you add it all up what do you get?
											Well, if you remember before World War II,
											Japan had a vision
											for a greater Japanese co-prosperity sphere.
											What&#39;s emerging today is what you might call
											a greater Chinese co-prosperity sphere.
											So no matter what the lines on the map tell you
											in terms of nations and borders,
											what you really have emerging in the far east
											are national cultures,
											but in a much more fluid, imperial zone.
											All of this is happening without firing a shot.

											That&#39;s most certainly not the case in the Middle East
											where countries are still very uncomfortable
											in the borders left behind by European colonialists.
											So what can we do to think about borders differently in this part of the world?
											What lines on the map should we focus on?
											What I want to present to you is what I call
											state building, day by day.

											Let&#39;s start with Iraq.
											Six years after the U.S. invasion of Iraq,
											the country still exists more on a map than it does in reality.
											Oil used to be one of the forces holding Iraq together;
											now it is the most significant cause of the country&#39;s disintegration.
											The reason is Kurdistan.
											The Kurds for 3,000 years
											have been waging a struggle for independence,
											and now is their chance to finally have it.
											These are pipeline routes, which emerge from Kurdistan,
											which is an oil-rich region.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And today, if you go to Kurdistan,
											you&#39;ll see that Kurdish Peshmerga guerillas
											are squaring off against the Sunni Iraqi army.
											But what are they guarding?
											Is it really a border on the map?
											No. It&#39;s the pipelines.
											If the Kurds can control their pipelines, they can set the terms
											of their own statehood.
											Now should we be upset about this, about the potential disintegration of Iraq?
											I don&#39;t believe we should.
											Iraq will still be the second largest oil producer in the world,
											behind Saudi Arabia.
											And we&#39;ll have a chance to solve a 3,000 year old dispute.
											Now remember Kurdistan is landlocked.
											It has no choice but to behave.
											In order to profit from its oil
											it has to export it through Turkey or Syria,
											and other countries, and Iraq itself.
											And therefore it has to have amicable relations with them.

											Now lets look at a perennial conflict in the region.
											That is, of course, in Palestine.
											Palestine is something of a cartographic anomaly
											because it&#39;s two parts Palestinian, one part Israel.
											30 years of rose garden diplomacy
											have not delivered us peace in this conflict.
											What might? I believe that what might
											solve the problem is infrastructure.
											Today donors are spending billions of dollars on this.

											Now what might this entire region look like
											if in fact we focus on other lines on the map besides borders,
											when the insecurities might abate?
											The last time that was the case was actually
											a century ago, during the Ottoman Empire.
											This is the Hejaz Railway.
											The Hejaz Railway ran from Istanbul to Medina via Damascus.
											It even had an offshoot running to Haifa
											in what is today Israel, on the Mediterranean Sea.
											But today the Hejaz Railway lies in tatters, ruins.
											If we were to focus on reconstructing these curvy lines on the map,
											infrastructure, that cross the straight lines, the borders,
											I believe the Middle East would be a far more peaceful region.

											Now let&#39;s look at another part of the world,

											that they don&#39;t really think of their region as the Middle East.
											So in other words, I believe that President Sarkozy of France
											is right when he talks about a Mediterranean union.

											Now let&#39;s look at Turkey and the Caucasus.
											I mentioned Azerbaijan before.
											That corridor of Turkey and the Caucasus
											has become the conduit for 20 percent
											of Europe&#39;s energy supply.
											So does Turkey really have to be a member of the European Union?
											I don&#39;t think it does. I think it&#39;s already part of
											a Euro-Turkish superpower.

											So what&#39;s next? Where are we going to see borders change
											and new countries born?
											Well, South Central Asia, South West Asia
											is a very good place to start.
											Eight years after the U.S. invaded Afghanistan
											there is still a tremendous amount of instability.
											Pakistan and Afghanistan are still so fragile
											that neither of them have dealt constructively
											with the problem of Pashtun nationalism.
											This is the flag that flies in the minds
											of 20 million Pashtuns
											who live on both sides of the Afghan and Pakistan border.

									<p>
											Let&#39;s not neglect the insurgency just to the south,
											Balochistan. Two weeks ago,
											Balochi rebels attacked a Pakistani military garrison,
											and this was the flag that they raised over it.
											The post-colonial entropy
											that is happening around the world is accelerating,
											and I expect more such changes to occur in the map
											as the states fragment.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Of course, we can&#39;t forget Africa.
											53 countries, and by far the most number
											of suspiciously straight lines on the map.
											If we were to look at all of Africa
											we could most certainly acknowledge far more,
											tribal divisions and so forth.
											But let&#39;s just look at Sudan, the second-largest country in Africa.
											It has three ongoing civil wars,
											the genocide in Darfur, which you all know about,
											the civil war in the east of the country,
											and south Sudan.
											South Sudan is going to be having a referendum in 2011
											in which it is very likely to vote itself independence.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now let&#39;s go up to the Arctic Circle.
											There is a great race on for energy resources
											under the Arctic seabed.
											Who will win? Canada? Russia? The United States?
											Actually Greenland.
											Several weeks ago Greenland&#39;s [60,000] people
											voted themselves self-governance rights
											from Denmark.
											So Denmark is about to get a whole lot smaller.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											What is the lesson from all of this?
											Geopolitics is a very unsentimental discipline.
											It&#39;s constantly morphing and changing the world,
											like climate change.
											And like our relationship with the ecosystem
											we&#39;re always searching for equilibrium
											in how we divide ourselves across the planet.
											Now we fear changes on the map.
											We fear civil wars, death tolls,
											having to learn the names of new countries.
											But I believe that the inertia of the existing borders that we have today
											is far worse and far more violent.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											The question is how do we change those borders,
											and what lines do we focus on?
											I believe we focus on the lines that cross borders,
											the infrastructure lines.
											Then we&#39;ll wind up with the world we want, a borderless one.
											Thank you.
											(Applause)
