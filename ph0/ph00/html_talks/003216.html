											America&#39;s public energy conversation

											Three-fourths of our oil fuel is transportation.
											Three-fourths of our electricity powers buildings.

											General Eisenhower reputedly said

											Oil costs our economy two billion dollars a day,
											plus another four billion dollars a day
											in hidden economic and military costs,
											raising its total cost to over a sixth of GDP.
											Our mobility fuel goes three-fifths to automobiles.
											So let&#39;s start by making autos oil free.
											Two-thirds of the energy it takes to move a typical car
											is caused by its weight.
											And every unit of energy you save at the wheels,
											by taking out weight or drag,
											saves seven units in the tank,

											Unfortunately, over the past quarter century,
											epidemic obesity has made our two-ton steel cars
											gain weight twice as fast as we have.
											But today, ultralight, ultrastrong materials,
											like carbon fiber composites,
											can make dramatic weight savings snowball
											and can make cars simpler and cheaper to build.
											Lighter and more slippery autos
											need less force to move them,
											so their engines get smaller.
											Indeed, that sort of vehicle fitness
											then makes electric propulsion affordable
											because the batteries or fuel cells
											also get smaller and lighter and cheaper.
											So sticker prices will ultimately fall to about the same as today,

											So these innovations together can transform automakers
											from wringing tiny savings
											out of Victorian engine and seal-stamping technologies
											to the steeply falling costs
											of three linked innovations that strongly reenforce each other —

											than America has steel workers.
											Already in about 20 states
											private installers will come
											put those cheap solar cells on your roof with no money down
											and beat your utility bill.
											Such unregulated products
											could ultimately add up to a virtual utility
											that bypasses your electric company
											just as your cellphone bypassed your wireline phone company.
											And this sort of thing gives utility executives the heebee-jeebees
											and it gives venture capitalists sweet dreams.

											Renewables are no longer a fringe activity.
											For each of the past four years
											half of the world&#39;s new generating capacity
											has been renewable,
											mainly lately in developing countries.
											In 2010, renewables other than big hydro,
											particularly wind and solar cells,
											got 151 billion dollars of private investment,
											and they actually surpassed the total installed capacity
											of nuclear power in the world
											by adding 60 billion watts in that one year.
											That happens to be the same amount of solar cell capacity
											that the world can now make every year —
											a number that goes up 60 or 70 percent a year.
											In contrast, the net additions of nuclear capacity and coal capacity
											and the orders behind those keep fading
											because they cost too much and they have too much financial risk.
											In fact in this country,
											no new nuclear power plant
											has been able to raise any private construction capital,
											despite seven years of 100-plus percent subsidies.

									<p>
											So how else could we replace the coal-fired power plants?
											Well efficiency and gas can displace them all
											at just below their operating cost
											and, combined with renewables, can displace them more than 23 times
											at less than their replacement cost.
											But we only need to replace them once.
											We&#39;re often told though
											that only coal and nuclear plants can keep the lights on,
											because they&#39;re 24/7,
											whereas wind and solar power are variable,
											and hence supposedly unreliable.

											Actually no generator is 24/7. They all break.
											And when a big plant goes down,
											you lose a thousand megawatts in milliseconds,
											often for weeks or months, often without warning.
											That is exactly why we&#39;ve designed the grid
											to back up failed plants with working plants.
											And in exactly the same way,
											the grid can handle wind and solar power&#39;s
											forecastable variations.

											Hourly simulations
											show that largely or wholly renewable grids
											can deliver highly reliable power
											when they&#39;re forecasted,
											integrated and diversified
											by both type and location.
											And that&#39;s true both for continental areas like the U.S. or Europe
											and for smaller areas embedded within a larger grid.
											That is how, for example,
											four German states in 2010
											were 43 to 52 percent wind powered.
											Portugal was 45 percent renewable powered,
											Denmark 36.
											And it&#39;s how all of Europe can shift
											to renewable electricity.
											In America, our aging, dirty and insecure power system
											has to be replaced anyway by 2050.
											And whatever we replace it with
											is going to cost about the same,
											about six trillion dollars at present value —
											whether we buy more of what we&#39;ve got
											or new nuclear and so-called clean coal,
											or renewables that are more or less centralized.

									<p>
											But those four futures at the same cost
											differ profoundly in their risks,
											around national security,
											fuel, water, finance, technology,
											climate and health.
											For example, our over-centralized grid
											is very vulnerable to cascading
											and potentially economy-shattering blackouts
											caused by bad space weather or other natural disasters
											or a terrorist attack.
											But that blackout risk disappears,
											and all of the other risks are best managed,
											with distributed renewables
											organized into local micro-grids that normally interconnect,
											but can stand alone at need.
											That is, they can disconnect fractally
											and then reconnect seamlessly.

											That approach is exactly what the Pentagon is adopting
											for its own power supply.
											They think they need that; how about the rest of us that they&#39;re defending?
											We want our stuff to work too.
											At about the same cost as business as usual,
											this would maximize national security,
											customer choice, entrepreneurial opportunity
											and innovation.

											Together, efficient use and diverse dispersed renewable supply
											are starting to transform the whole electricity sector.
											Traditionally utilities build
											a lot of giant coal and nuclear plants
											and a bunch of big gas plants
											and maybe a little bit of efficiency renewables.
											And those utilities were rewarded,
											as they still are in 34 states,
											for selling you more electricity.
											However, especially where regulators
											are now instead rewarding cutting your bills,
											the investments are shifting radically
											toward efficiency, demand response, cogeneration,
											renewables and ways to knit them all together reliably
											with less transmission
											and little or no bulk electricity storage.

											So our energy future is not fate, but choice,
											and that choice is very flexible.
											In 1976, for example,
											government and industry insisted
											that the amount of energy needed to make a dollar of GDP
											could never go down.
											And I heretically suggested it could go down several-fold.
											Well that&#39;s what&#39;s actually happened so far.
											It&#39;s fallen by half.
											But with today&#39;s much better technologies,
											more mature delivery channels and integrative design,
											we can do far more and even cheaper.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So to solve the energy problem,
											we just needed to enlarge it.
											And the results may at first seem incredible,
											but as Marshall McLuhan said,
											&quot;Only puny secrets need protection.
											Big discoveries are protected by public incredulity.&quot;
											Now combine the electricity and oil revolutions,
											both driven by modern efficiency,
											and you get the really big story: reinventing fire,
											where business enabled and sped by smart policies in mindful markets
											can lead the United States completely off oil and coal by 2050,
											saving 5 trillion dollars,
											growing the economy 2.6-fold,
											strengthening out national security,
											oh, and by the way, by getting rid of the oil and coal,
											reducing the fossil carbon emissions by 82 to 86 percent.

									<p>
											Now if you like any of those outcomes,
											you can support reinventing fire
											without needing to like all of them
											and without needing to agree about which of them is most important.
											So focusing on outcomes, not motives,
											can turn gridlock and conflict
											into a unifying solution to America&#39;s energy challenge.
											This also turns out to be the best way
											to cope with global challenges —
											climate change, nuclear proliferation,
											energy insecurity, energy poverty —
											all of which make us less safe.

											Now our team at RMI helps smart companies
											to get unstuck and speed this journey

											Of course there&#39;s still a lot of old thinking out there too.
											Former oil man Maurice Strong said,
											&quot;Not all the fossils are in the fuel.&quot;
											But as Edgar Woolard, who used to chair Dupont, reminds us,

											I&#39;ve described not just a once-in-a-civilization
											business opportunity,

											We humans are inventing a new fire,

											not transient, but permanent;
											not costly, but free.

Since studying at Harvard and Oxford in the 1960s, he&#39;s written dozens of books, and initiated ambitious projects -- cofounding the influential, environment-focused <a href=\"http://www.rmi.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Rocky Mountain Institute</a>; prototyping the ultra-efficient Hypercar -- to <strong>focus the world&#39;s attention on alternative approaches to energy</strong> and transportation. </p><p>His critical thinking has driven people around the globe -- from world leaders to the average Joe -- to <strong>think differently about energy and its role in some of our biggest problems</strong>: climate change, oil dependency, national security, economic health, and depletion of natural resources. </p><p>Lovins offers solutions as well. His new book and site, <a href=\"http://www.rmi.org/ReinventingFire\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Reinventing Fire</em></a>, offers actionable solutions for four energy-intensive sectors of the  economy: transportation, buildings, industry and electricity. Lovins has always focused on solutions that conserve natural resources while also promoting economic growth; Texas Instruments and Wal-Mart are just two of the mega-corporations he has advised on improving energy efficiency. </p>"}],"speaker_name":"Amory Lovins","tags":["alternative energy","energy","science","solar energy","technology","wind energy","engineering","climate change","invention","innovation","design","economics","business","green","future","materials","industrial design","environment","sustainability","natural resources","electricity"],"title":"A 40-year plan for energy","video_type":{"id":"1","name":"TED Stage Talk"},"viewed_count":1238602}]}})</script></div>
