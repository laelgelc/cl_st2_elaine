<title>Tania Simoncelli: Should you be able to patent a human gene? | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: A decade ago, US law said human genes were patentable -- which meant patent holders had the right to stop anyone from sequencing, testing or even looking at a patented gene. Troubled by the way this law both harmed patients and created a barrier to biomedical innovation, Tania Simoncelli and her colleagues at the ACLU challenged it. In this riveting talk, hear the story of how they took a case everybody told them they would lose all the way to the Supreme Court." />

<meta content='A decade ago, US law said human genes were patentable — which meant patent holders had the right to stop anyone from sequencing, testing or even looking at a patented gene. Troubled by the way this law both harmed patients and created a barrier to biomedical innovation, Tania Simoncelli and her colleagues at the ACLU challenged it. In this riveting talk, hear the story of how they took a case everybody told them they would lose all the way to the Supreme Court.' itemprop='description'>

											It was an afternoon in the fall of 2005.
											I was working at the ACLU

											First, we needed to understand
exactly what was patented
											when someone patented a gene.
											Gene patents typically contain
dozens of claims,
											but the most controversial of these
are to so-called &quot;isolated DNA&quot; —
											namely, a piece of DNA
that has been removed from a cell.

											Gene patent proponents say,
											&quot;See? We didn&#39;t patent
the gene in your body,
											we patented an isolated gene.&quot;
											And that&#39;s true,
											but the problem is that any use
of the gene requires that it be isolated.
											And the patents weren&#39;t just
to a particular gene that they isolated,
											but on every possible
version of that gene.

											It also means that the patent holder
has the right to stop anyone

											Consider Abigail,

											The company that obtained a patent on two
genes associated with this condition

threatened to sue the lab

											Why is that?
											Well, the patent office
had been issuing these patents
											for more than 20 years.
											There were literally thousands
of patents on human genes.
											The patent bar was deeply
entrenched in the status quo,
											the biotech industry had grown up
around this practice,
											and legislation to ban gene patents
had been introduced
											year after year in Congress,
											and had gone absolutely nowhere.
											So the bottom line:
											courts just weren&#39;t going to be willing
to overturn these patents.

was much bigger than that.
											This was about scientific freedom,

											We found the prime candidate
to sue in Myriad Genetics,

in Salt Lake City, Utah.
											Myriad held patents on two genes,
											the BRCA1 and the BRCA2 genes.
											Women with certain mutations
along these genes
											are considered to be
at a significantly increased risk
											of developing breast and ovarian cancer.
											Myriad had used its patents to maintain
											a complete monopoly on BRCA testing
in the United States.
											It had forced multiple labs
that were offering BRCA testing to stop.
											It charged a lot of money for its test —
											over 3,000 dollars.
											It had stopped sharing its clinical data
											with the international
scientific community.
											And perhaps worst of all,
											for a period of several years,
											Myriad refused to update its test
to include additional mutations

											This is Kathleen Maxian.
											Kathleen&#39;s sister Eileen

											That meant that Eileen&#39;s cancer
most likely didn&#39;t run in the family,
											and that other members of her family
didn&#39;t need to be tested.
											But two years later,

with advanced-stage ovarian cancer.
											It turned out that Kathleen&#39;s sister

											geneticists who had received

that collectively represented
											more than 150,000 scientists

											One of the major challenges
we had in preparing the case
											was figuring out how best
to communicate the science.
											So in order to argue that what Myriad did
was not an invention,
											and that isolated BRCA genes
were products of nature,
											we had to explain a couple
of basic concepts, like:

											So now we sought review
by the Supreme Court.

that you want the Court to answer.
											Usually these questions take the form
of a super-long paragraph,
											like a whole page long

											Chris and I sat quietly in the hallway,

											But any remaining panic subsided
as I walked into the courtroom
											and looked around
at a sea of friendly faces:
											our individual women clients
											who had shared their
deeply personal stories,
											the geneticists who had taken huge chunks
of time out of their busy careers
											to dedicate themselves to this fight

											The argument itself was riveting.
											Chris argued brilliantly.
											But for me,
											the most thrilling aspect was watching
the Supreme Court justices grapple
											with isolated DNA,
											through a series of colorful analogies
and feisty exchanges,
											very much the same way
as our legal team had done
											for the past seven years.
											Justice Kagan likened isolating DNA
											to extracting a medicinal plant
from the Amazon.
											Justice Roberts distinguished it
from carving a baseball bat from a tree.
											And in one of my absolutely
favorite moments,
											Justice Sotomayor proclaimed isolated DNA
to be &quot;just nature sitting there.&quot;

											&quot;A naturally occurring DNA segment
is a product of nature,

											Myriad did not create anything.&quot;

											Within 24 hours of the decision,
											five labs had announced
											that they would begin to offer testing
for the BRCA genes.
											Some of them promised to offer the tests
at a lower price than Myriad&#39;s.
											Some promised to provide
a more comprehensive test

											But of course the decision
goes far beyond Myriad.
											It ends a 25-year practice
of allowing patents on human genes
											in the United States.
											It clears a significant barrier
to biomedical discovery and innovation.
											And it helps to ensure that patients
like Abigail, Kathleen and Eileen
