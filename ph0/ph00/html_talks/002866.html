the health of the conversation.

the public conversation,

a number of attacks on it.
											We&#39;ve seen abuse, we&#39;ve seen harassment,

											So these are all dynamics
that we were not expecting

I&#39;m really glad to hear
											that that&#39;s something that concerns you,

a lot written about people
											who feel they&#39;ve been abused
and harassed on Twitter,
											and I think no one more so
than women and women of color
											and black women.
											And there&#39;s been data that&#39;s come out —
											Amnesty International put out
a report a few months ago
											where they showed that a subset
of active black female Twitter users
											were receiving, on average,
one in 10 of their tweets
											were some form of harassment.
											And so when you think about health
for the community on Twitter,
											I&#39;m interested to hear,
&quot;health for everyone,&quot;
											but specifically: How are you looking
to make Twitter a safe space
											for that subset, for women,
for women of color and black women?

											JD: Yeah.
											So it&#39;s a pretty terrible situation
											when you&#39;re coming to a service
											that, ideally, you want to learn
something about the world,
											and you spend the majority of your time
reporting abuse, receiving abuse,
											receiving harassment.
											So what we&#39;re looking most deeply at
is just the incentives
											that the platform naturally provides
and the service provides.
											Right now, the dynamic of the system
makes it super-easy to harass
											and to abuse others through the service,
											and unfortunately, the majority
of our system in the past
											worked entirely based on people
reporting harassment and abuse.
											So about midway last year,
we decided that we were going to apply
											a lot more machine learning,
a lot more deep learning to the problem,
											and try to be a lot more proactive
around where abuse is happening,
											so that we can take the burden
off the victim completely.
											And we&#39;ve made some progress recently.
											About 38 percent of abusive tweets
are now proactively identified
											by machine learning algorithms
											so that people don&#39;t actually
have to report them.
											But those that are identified
are still reviewed by humans,
											so we do not take down content or accounts
without a human actually reviewing it.
											But that was from zero percent
just a year ago.
											So that meant, at that zero percent,
											every single person who received abuse
had to actually report it,
											which was a lot of work for them,
a lot of work for us
											and just ultimately unfair.

											The other thing that we&#39;re doing
is making sure that we, as a company,
											have representation of all the communities
that we&#39;re trying to serve.
											We can&#39;t build a business
that is successful
											unless we have a diversity
of perspective inside of our walls
											that actually feel these issues
every single day.
											And that&#39;s not just with the team
that&#39;s doing the work,
											it&#39;s also within our leadership as well.
											So we need to continue to build empathy
for what people are experiencing
											and give them better tools to act on it
											and also give our customers
a much better and easier approach
											to handle some of the things
that they&#39;re seeing.
											So a lot of what we&#39;re doing
is around technology,
											but we&#39;re also looking at
the incentives on the service:
											What does Twitter incentivize you to do
when you first open it up?
											And in the past,
											it&#39;s incented a lot of outrage,
it&#39;s incented a lot of mob behavior,
											it&#39;s incented a lot of group harassment.
											And we have to look a lot deeper
at some of the fundamentals
											of what the service is doing
to make the bigger shifts.
											We can make a bunch of small shifts
around technology, as I just described,
											but ultimately, we have to look deeply
at the dynamics in the network itself,
											and that&#39;s what we&#39;re doing.

											JD: Well, one of the things —
											we started the service
with this concept of following an account,
											as an example,
											and I don&#39;t believe that&#39;s why
people actually come to Twitter.
											I believe Twitter is best
as an interest-based network.
											People come with a particular interest.
											They have to do a ton of work
to find and follow the related accounts
											around those interests.
											What we could do instead
is allow you to follow an interest,
											follow a hashtag, follow a trend,
											follow a community,
											which gives us the opportunity
to show all of the accounts,
											all the topics, all the moments,
all the hashtags
											that are associated with that
particular topic and interest,
											which really opens up
the perspective that you see.
											But that is a huge fundamental shift
											to bias the entire network
away from just an account bias
											towards a topics and interest bias.

so much content on there

											JD: Yeah, I mean, I think you&#39;re spot on,
											but that goes back to the incentives.
											Like, one of the choices
we made in the early days was
											we had this number that showed
how many people follow you.
											We decided that number
should be big and bold,
											and anything that&#39;s on the page
that&#39;s big and bold has importance,
											and those are the things
that you want to drive.
											Was that the right decision at the time?
											Probably not.
											If I had to start the service again,
											I would not emphasize
the follower count as much.
											I would not emphasize
the &quot;like&quot; count as much.
											I don&#39;t think I would even
create &quot;like&quot; in the first place,
											because it doesn&#39;t actually push
											what we believe now
to be the most important thing,
											which is healthy contribution
back to the network
											and conversation to the network,
											participation within conversation,

											WPR: I think one I saw that 
passed already quickly down here,
											&quot;What&#39;s Twitter&#39;s plan to combat
foreign meddling in the 2020 US election?&quot;
											I think that&#39;s something
that&#39;s an issue we&#39;re seeing
											on the internet in general,
											that we have a lot of malicious
automated activity happening.
											And on Twitter, for example,
in fact, we have some work
											that&#39;s come from our friends
at Zignal Labs,
											and maybe we can even see that
to give us an example
											of what exactly I&#39;m talking about,
											where you have these bots, if you will,
											or coordinated automated
malicious account activity,
											that is being used to influence
things like elections.
											And in this example we have
from Zignal which they&#39;ve shared with us
											using the data that
they have from Twitter,
											you actually see that in this case,
											white represents the humans —
human accounts, each dot is an account.
											The pinker it is,
											the more automated the activity is.
											And you can see how you have
a few humans interacting with bots.
											In this case, it&#39;s related
to the election in Israel
											and spreading misinformation
about Benny Gantz,

that was an election
											that Netanyahu won by a slim margin,

in some case influenced by this.

											JD: Just to back up a bit,
											we asked ourselves a question:
											Can we actually measure
the health of a conversation,
											and what does that mean?
											And in the same way
that you have indicators
											and we have indicators as humans
in terms of are we healthy or not,
											such as temperature,
the flushness of your face,
											we believe that we could find
the indicators of conversational health.
											And we worked with a lab
called Cortico at MIT
											to propose four starter indicators
											that we believe we could ultimately
measure on the system.
											And the first one is
what we&#39;re calling shared attention.
											It&#39;s a measure of how much
of the conversation is attentive
											on the same topic versus disparate.
											The second one is called shared reality,
											and this is what percentage
of the conversation
											shares the same facts —
											not whether those facts
are truthful or not,
											but are we sharing
the same facts as we converse?
											The third is receptivity:
											How much of the conversation
is receptive or civil
											or the inverse, toxic?
											And then the fourth
is variety of perspective.
											So, are we seeing filter bubbles
or echo chambers,
											or are we actually getting
a variety of opinions
											within the conversation?
											And implicit in all four of these
is the understanding that,
											as they increase, the conversation
gets healthier and healthier.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So our first step is to see
if we can measure these online,
											which we believe we can.
											We have the most momentum
around receptivity.
											We have a toxicity score,
a toxicity model, on our system
											that can actually measure
whether you are likely to walk away
											from a conversation
that you&#39;re having on Twitter
											because you feel it&#39;s toxic,
											with some pretty high degree.
											We&#39;re working to measure the rest,
											and the next step is,
											as we build up solutions,
											to watch how these measurements
trend over time
											and continue to experiment.
											And our goal is to make sure
that these are balanced,
											because if you increase one,
you might decrease another.
											If you increase variety of perspective,
											you might actually decrease
shared reality.

feeling like you learned something.
											Some people do.
											Some people have
a very, very rich network,
											a very rich community
that they learn from every single day.
											But it takes a lot of work
and a lot of time to build up to that.
											So we want to get people
to those topics and those interests
											much, much faster
											and make sure that
they&#39;re finding something that,
											no matter how much time
they spend on Twitter —
											and I don&#39;t want to maximize
the time on Twitter,
											I want to maximize
what they actually take away from it
											and what they learn from it, and —

											CA: But just — on that goal,
daily active usage,
											if you&#39;re measuring that,
that doesn&#39;t necessarily mean things
											that people value every day.
											It may well mean
											things that people are drawn to
like a moth to the flame, every day.
											We are addicted, because we see
something that pisses us off,
											so we go in and add fuel to the fire,
											and the daily active usage goes up,
											and there&#39;s more ad revenue there,
											but we all get angrier with each other.
											How do you define ...
											&quot;Daily active usage&quot; seems like a really
dangerous term to be optimizing.

healthy contribution back to the network,

											JD: Yes, and we have been
moving substantially.
											I mean, there&#39;s been
a few dynamics in Twitter&#39;s history.
											One, when I came back to the company,
											we were in a pretty dire state
in terms of our future,
											and not just from how people
were using the platform,
											but from a corporate narrative as well.
											So we had to fix
a bunch of the foundation,
											turn the company around,
											go through two crazy layoffs,
											because we just got too big
for what we were doing,
											and we focused all of our energy
											on this concept of serving
the public conversation.
											And that took some work.
											And as we dived into that,
											we realized some of the issues
with the fundamentals.
											We could do a bunch of superficial things
to address what you&#39;re talking about,
											but we need the changes to last,
											and that means going really, really deep
											and paying attention
to what we started 13 years ago
											and really questioning
											how the system works
and how the framework works
											and what is needed for the world today,
											given how quickly everything is moving
and how people are using it.
											So we are working as quickly as we can,
but quickness will not get the job done.
											It&#39;s focus, it&#39;s prioritization,
											it&#39;s understanding
the fundamentals of the network
											and building a framework that scales
											and that is resilient to change,
											and being open about where we are
and being transparent about where are
											so that we can continue to earn trust.

of stupid stuff we were doing in the past.

He spent his early years in India, Pakistan and Afghanistan, where his parents worked as medical missionaries, and he attended an American school in the Himalayas for his early education. After boarding school in Bath, England, he went on to Oxford University, graduating in 1978 with a degree in philosophy, politics and economics.</p><p class=\"p1\">Chris then trained as a journalist, working in newspapers and radio, including two years producing a world news service in the Seychelles Islands.</p><p class=\"p1\"> Back in the UK in 1984, Chris was captivated by the personal computer revolution and became an editor at one of the UK&#39;s early computer magazines. A year later he founded Future Publishing with a $25,000 bank loan. The new company initially focused on specialist computer publications but eventually expanded into other areas such as cycling, music, video games, technology and design, doubling in size every year for seven years. In 1994, Chris moved to the United States where he built Imagine Media, publisher of <em>Business 2.0</em> magazine and creator of the popular video game users website IGN. Chris eventually merged Imagine and Future, taking the combined entity public in London in 1999, under the Future name. At its peak, it published 150 magazines and websites and employed 2,000 people.</p><p class=\"p1\">This success allowed Chris to create a private nonprofit organization, the Sapling Foundation, with the hope of finding new ways to tackle tough global issues through media, technology, entrepreneurship and, most of all, ideas. In 2001, the foundation acquired the TED Conference, then an annual meeting of luminaries in the fields of Technology, Entertainment and Design held in Monterey, California, and Chris left Future to work full time on TED.</p><p class=\"p1\">He expanded the conference&#39;s remit to cover all topics, including science, business and key global issues, while adding a Fellows program, which now has some 300 alumni, and the TED Prize, which grants its recipients &quot;one wish to change the world.&quot; The TED stage has become a place for thinkers and doers from all fields to share their ideas and their work, capturing imaginations, sparking conversation and encouraging discovery along the way.</p><p class=\"p1\">In 2006, TED experimented with posting some of its talks on the Internet. Their viral success encouraged Chris to begin positioning the organization as a global media initiative devoted to &#39;ideas worth spreading,&#39; part of a new era of information dissemination using the power of online video. In June 2015, the organization posted its 2,000th talk online. The talks are free to view, and they have been translated into more than 100 languages with the help of volunteers from around the world. Viewership has grown to approximately one billion views per year.</p><p class=\"p1\">Continuing a strategy of &#39;radical openness,&#39; in 2009 Chris introduced the TEDx initiative, allowing free licenses to local organizers who wished to organize their own TED-like events. More than 8,000 such events have been held, generating an archive of 60,000 TEDx talks. And three years later, the TED-Ed program was launched, offering free educational videos and tools to students and teachers.</p>"},{"id":"5278","slug":"whitney_pennington_rodgers","is_published":true,"firstname":"Whitney","lastname":"Pennington Rodgers","middleinitial":"","title":"","description":"TED Current Affairs Curator","photo_url":"https://pe.tedcdn.com/images/ted/376c19d3c178f374d260d1dee9aea3004d543863_254x191.jpg","whatotherssay":"","whotheyare":"Whitney Pennington Rodgers is an award-winning journalist and media professional.","whylisten":"<p>Prior to joining TED as current affairs curator, Whitney Pennington Rodgers produced for NBC&#39;s primetime news magazine <em>Dateline NBC</em>.

He spent his early years in India, Pakistan and Afghanistan, where his parents worked as medical missionaries, and he attended an American school in the Himalayas for his early education. After boarding school in Bath, England, he went on to Oxford University, graduating in 1978 with a degree in philosophy, politics and economics.</p><p class=\"p1\">Chris then trained as a journalist, working in newspapers and radio, including two years producing a world news service in the Seychelles Islands.</p><p class=\"p1\"> Back in the UK in 1984, Chris was captivated by the personal computer revolution and became an editor at one of the UK&#39;s early computer magazines. A year later he founded Future Publishing with a $25,000 bank loan. The new company initially focused on specialist computer publications but eventually expanded into other areas such as cycling, music, video games, technology and design, doubling in size every year for seven years. In 1994, Chris moved to the United States where he built Imagine Media, publisher of <em>Business 2.0</em> magazine and creator of the popular video game users website IGN. Chris eventually merged Imagine and Future, taking the combined entity public in London in 1999, under the Future name. At its peak, it published 150 magazines and websites and employed 2,000 people.</p><p class=\"p1\">This success allowed Chris to create a private nonprofit organization, the Sapling Foundation, with the hope of finding new ways to tackle tough global issues through media, technology, entrepreneurship and, most of all, ideas. In 2001, the foundation acquired the TED Conference, then an annual meeting of luminaries in the fields of Technology, Entertainment and Design held in Monterey, California, and Chris left Future to work full time on TED.</p><p class=\"p1\">He expanded the conference&#39;s remit to cover all topics, including science, business and key global issues, while adding a Fellows program, which now has some 300 alumni, and the TED Prize, which grants its recipients &quot;one wish to change the world.&quot; The TED stage has become a place for thinkers and doers from all fields to share their ideas and their work, capturing imaginations, sparking conversation and encouraging discovery along the way.</p><p class=\"p1\">In 2006, TED experimented with posting some of its talks on the Internet. Their viral success encouraged Chris to begin positioning the organization as a global media initiative devoted to &#39;ideas worth spreading,&#39; part of a new era of information dissemination using the power of online video. In June 2015, the organization posted its 2,000th talk online. The talks are free to view, and they have been translated into more than 100 languages with the help of volunteers from around the world. Viewership has grown to approximately one billion views per year.</p><p class=\"p1\">Continuing a strategy of &#39;radical openness,&#39; in 2009 Chris introduced the TEDx initiative, allowing free licenses to local organizers who wished to organize their own TED-like events. More than 8,000 such events have been held, generating an archive of 60,000 TEDx talks. And three years later, the TED-Ed program was launched, offering free educational videos and tools to students and teachers.</p>"},{"id":"5278","slug":"whitney_pennington_rodgers","is_published":true,"firstname":"Whitney","lastname":"Pennington Rodgers","middleinitial":"","title":"","description":"TED Current Affairs Curator","photo_url":"https://pe.tedcdn.com/images/ted/376c19d3c178f374d260d1dee9aea3004d543863_254x191.jpg","whatotherssay":"","whotheyare":"Whitney Pennington Rodgers is an award-winning journalist and media professional.","whylisten":"<p>Prior to joining TED as current affairs curator, Whitney Pennington Rodgers produced for NBC&#39;s primetime news magazine <em>Dateline NBC</em>.
