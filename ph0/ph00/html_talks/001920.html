											So the first question is,
&quot;Do we really have to change?&quot;
											And of course, the Apollo Mission,
among other things
											changed the environmental movement,
											really launched the modern
environmental movement.
											18 months after this Earthrise picture
was first seen on earth,
											the first Earth Day was organized.
											And we learned a lot about ourselves
											looking back at our planet from space.
											And one of the things that we learned
											confirmed what the scientists
have long told us.
											One of the most essential facts
											about the climate crisis
has to do with the sky.
											As this picture illustrates,
											the sky is not the vast
and limitless expanse
											that appears when we look up
from the ground.
											It is a very thin shell of atmosphere
											surrounding the planet.
											That right now is the open sewer
for our industrial civilization
											as it&#39;s currently organized.

											And there are many sources
of the greenhouse gases,
											I&#39;m certainly not going
to go through them all.
											I&#39;m going to focus on the main one,
											but agriculture is involved,
diet is involved, population is involved.
											Management of forests, transportation,
											the oceans, the melting of the permafrost.
											But I&#39;m going to focus
on the heart of the problem,
											which is the fact that we still rely
on dirty, carbon-based fuels
											for 85 percent of all the energy
that our world burns every year.
											And you can see from this image
that after World War II,
											the emission rates
started really accelerating.
											And the accumulated amount
of man-made, global warming pollution
											that is up in the atmosphere now
											traps as much extra heat energy
as would be released

											Let&#39;s look at the atmosphere.
											This is a depiction
											of what we used to think of as
the normal distribution of temperatures.
											The white represents
normal temperature days;
											1951-1980 are arbitrarily chosen.
											The blue are cooler than average days,
											the red are warmer than average days.
											But the entire curve has moved
to the right in the 1980s.
											And you&#39;ll see
in the lower right-hand corner
											the appearance of statistically
significant numbers
											of extremely hot days.
											In the 90s, the curve shifted further.
											And in the last 10 years,
you see the extremely hot days
											are now more numerous
than the cooler than average days.
											In fact, they are 150 times more common

											So we&#39;re having
record-breaking temperatures.
											Fourteen of the 15 of the hottest years
ever measured with instruments
											have been in this young century.
											The hottest of all was last year.
											Last month was the 371st month in a row
											warmer than the 20th-century average.
											And for the first time,
not only the warmest January,
											but for the first time, it was more
than two degrees Fahrenheit warmer

											But on a global basis, 93 percent
of all the extra heat energy
											is trapped in the oceans.
											And the scientists can measure
the heat buildup
											much more precisely now
											at all depths: deep, mid-ocean,
											the first few hundred meters.
											And this, too, is accelerating.
											It goes back more than a century.

											The first order of consequence:
											the ocean-based storms get stronger.
											Super Typhoon Haiyan
went over areas of the Pacific
											five and a half degrees Fahrenheit
warmer than normal
											before it slammed into Tacloban,
											as the most destructive storm
ever to make landfall.
											Pope Francis, who has made
such a difference to this whole issue,
											visited Tacloban right after that.
											Superstorm Sandy went over
areas of the Atlantic
											nine degrees warmer than normal
											before slamming into
New York and New Jersey.
											The second order of consequences
are affecting all of us right now.
											The warmer oceans are evaporating
much more water vapor into the skies.
											Average humidity worldwide
has gone up four percent.
											And it creates these atmospheric rivers.
											The Brazilian scientists
call them &quot;flying rivers.&quot;
											And they funnel all of that
extra water vapor over the land
											where storm conditions trigger
these massive record-breaking downpours.
											This is from Montana.
											Take a look at this storm last August.

											The insurance industry
has certainly noticed,

about what&#39;s happening.
											And the causality requires
a moment of discussion.
											We&#39;re used to thinking of linear cause

											As the great Kevin Trenberth says,

											there&#39;s so much extra water vapor.

											said the climate crisis is now
the number one risk
											to the global economy.

											28 trillion dollars.

											between 32 degrees Fahrenheit
and 33 degrees Fahrenheit,
											or zero and one Celsius.
											It&#39;s a difference of more than one degree,
											it&#39;s the difference between ice and water.
											And it&#39;s the difference between markets
that are frozen up,
											and liquid flows of capital
into new opportunities for investment.
											This is the biggest
new business opportunity
											in the history of the world,
											and two-thirds of it
is in the private sector.
											We are seeing an explosion
of new investment.
											Starting in 2010, investments globally
in renewable electricity generation
											surpassed fossils.
											The gap has been growing ever since.
											The projections for the future
are even more dramatic,
											even though fossil energy
is now still subsidized
											at a rate 40 times larger than renewables.
											And by the way, if you add
the projections for nuclear on here,
											particularly if you assume
that the work many are doing
											to try to break through to safer
and more acceptable,
											more affordable forms of nuclear,
											this could change even more dramatically.

											So is there any precedent
for such a rapid adoption
											of a new technology?
											Well, there are many,
but let&#39;s look at cell phones.
											In 1980, AT&amp;T, then Ma Bell,
											commissioned McKinsey to do
a global market survey
											of those clunky new mobile phones
that appeared then.
											&quot;How many can we sell
by the year 2000?&quot; they asked.
											McKinsey came back and said, &quot;900,000.&quot;
											And sure enough,
when the year 2000 arrived,
											they did sell 900,000 —
in the first three days.
											And for the balance of the year,
they sold 120 times more.
											And now there are more cell connections
than there are people in the world.

											And I think the answer is in three parts.
											First, the cost came down much faster
than anybody expected,
											even as the quality went up.
											And low-income countries, places
that did not have a landline grid —
											they leap-frogged to the new technology.
											The big expansion has been
in the developing counties.
											So what about the electricity grids
in the developing world?
											Well, not so hot.
											And in many areas, they don&#39;t exist.
											There are more people
without any electricity at all in India
											than the entire population
of the United States of America.
											So now we&#39;re getting this:
											solar panels on grass huts
											and new business models
that make it affordable.
											Muhammad Yunus financed
this one in Bangladesh with micro-credit.
											This is a village market.
											Bangladesh is now the fastest-deploying
country in the world:
											two systems per minute
on average, night and day.
											And we have all we need:
											enough energy from the Sun
comes to the earth
											every hour to supply the full world&#39;s
energy needs for an entire year.
											It&#39;s actually a little bit
less than an hour.
											So the answer to the second question,
&quot;Can we change?&quot;
											is clearly &quot;Yes.&quot;
											And it&#39;s an ever-firmer &quot;yes.&quot;

									<p>
											Last question, &quot;Will we change?&quot;
											Paris really was a breakthrough,
											some of the provisions are binding
											and the regular reviews will matter a lot.
											But nations aren&#39;t waiting,
they&#39;re going ahead.
											China has already announced
that starting next year,
											they&#39;re adopting a nationwide
cap and trade system.
											They will likely link up
with the European Union.
											The United States
has already been changing.
											All of these coal plants were proposed
											in the next 10 years and canceled.
											All of these existing
coal plants were retired.
											All of these coal plants have had
their retirement announced.
											All of them — canceled.
											We are moving forward.
											Last year — if you look at
all of the investment
											in new electricity generation
in the United States,
											almost three-quarters
was from renewable energy,
											mostly wind and solar.

											We are solving this crisis.
											The only question is:
how long will it take to get there?
											So, it matters that a lot
of people are organizing
											to insist on this change.
											Almost 400,000 people
marched in New York City
											before the UN special session on this.
											Many thousands, tens of thousands,
											marched in cities around the world.
											And so, I am extremely optimistic.

											I&#39;ll finish with this story.
											When I was 13 years old,
											I heard that proposal by President Kennedy
											to land a person on the Moon
and bring him back safely
											in 10 years.
											And I heard adults
of that day and time say,
											&quot;That&#39;s reckless, expensive,
may well fail.&quot;
											But eight years and two months later,
											in the moment that Neil Armstrong
set foot on the Moon,
											there was great cheer that went up
in NASA&#39;s mission control in Houston.
											Here&#39;s a little-known fact about that:
											the average age of the systems engineers,
											the controllers in the room
that day, was 26,
											which means, among other things,
											their age, when they heard
that challenge, was 18.

											We now have a moral challenge
											that is in the tradition of others
that we have faced.
											One of the greatest poets
of the last century in the US,
											Wallace Stevens,
											wrote a line that has stayed with me:
											&quot;After the final &#39;no,&#39;
there comes a &#39;yes,&#39;
											and on that &#39;yes&#39;,
the future world depends.&quot;
											When the abolitionists
started their movement,
											they met with no after no after no.
											And then came a yes.
											The Women&#39;s Suffrage
and Women&#39;s Rights Movement
											met endless no&#39;s, until finally,
there was a yes.
											The Civil Rights Movement,
the movement against apartheid,
											and more recently, the movement
for gay and lesbian rights
											here in the United States and elsewhere.
											After the final &quot;no&quot; comes a &quot;yes.&quot;

											When any great moral challenge
is ultimately resolved

because of who we are as human beings.
											Ninety-nine percent of us,
that is where we are now
											and it is why we&#39;re going to win this.
											We have everything we need.
											Some still doubt that we have
the will to act,

a renewable resource.
