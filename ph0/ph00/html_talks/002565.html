											So today&#39;s top chef class is in how to rob a bank,
											and it&#39;s clear that the general public needs guidance,
											because the average bank robbery nets
											only 7,500 dollars.
											Rank amateurs who know nothing
											about how to cook the books.

											The folks who know, of course,
											run our largest banks,
											and in the last go-around,
											they cost us over 11 trillion dollars.
											That&#39;s what 11 trillion looks like.
											That&#39;s how many zeros?
											And cost us over 10 million jobs as well.

											So our task is to educate ourselves
											so that we can understand
											why we have these recurrent,
											intensifying financial crises,
											and how we can prevent them in the future.
											And the answer to that is
											that we have to stop epidemics of control fraud.
											Control fraud is what happens
											when the people who control,
											typically a CEO,
											a seemingly legitimate entity,
											use it as a weapon to defraud.
											And these are the weapons of mass destruction
											in the financial world.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											They also follow in finance a particular strategy,
											because the weapon of choice in finance
											is accounting,
											and there is a recipe for accounting
											control fraud, and how it occurs.
											And we discovered this recipe
											in quite an odd way that I&#39;ll
come back to in a moment.
											First ingredient in the recipe: grow like crazy;
											second, by making or buying really crappy loans,
											but loans that are made at a very high interest rate
											or yield;
											three, while employing extreme leverage —
											that just means a lot of debt —
											compared to your equity;
											and four, while providing only trivial loss reserves
											against the inevitable losses.
											If you follow those four simple steps,
											and any bank can follow them,
											then you are mathematically guaranteed
											to have three things occur.
											The first thing is
											you will report record bank profits —
											not just high, record.
											Two, the CEO will immediately
be made incredibly wealthy
											by modern executive compensation.
											And three, farther down the road,
											the bank will suffer catastrophic losses
											and will fail unless it is bailed out.
											And that&#39;s a hint as to how
											we discovered this recipe,
											because we discovered it
through an autopsy process.
											During the savings and loan debacle in 1984,
											we looked at every single failure,
											and we looked for common characteristics,
											and we discovered this recipe was common
											to each of these frauds.
											In other words, a coroner could find these things
											because this is a fatal recipe
											that will destroy the banks
											as well as the economy.
											And it also turns out to be precisely
											what could have stopped this crisis,
											the one that cost us 11 trillion dollars
											just in the household sector,
											that cost us 10 million jobs,
											was the easiest financial crisis by far
											to have avoided completely
											if we had simply learned the lessons
											of epidemics of control fraud,
											particularly using this recipe.
											So let&#39;s go to this crisis,
											and the two huge epidemics
											of loan origination fraud that drove the crisis —
											appraisal fraud and liar&#39;s loans —
											and what we&#39;re going to see
											in looking at both of these is
											we got warnings that were incredibly early
											about these frauds.
											We got warnings that we could
have taken advantage of easily,
											because back in the savings and loan debacle,
											we had figured out how to respond
											and prevent these crises.
											And three, the warnings were unambiguous.
											They were obvious that what was going on
											was an epidemic of accounting control fraud building up.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Let&#39;s take appraisal fraud first.
											This is simply where you inflate the value
											of the home that is being pledged
											as security for the loan.
											In 2000, the year 2000,
											that is over a year before Enron fails, by the way,
											the honest appraisers got together a formal petition
											begging the federal government to act,
											and the industry to act,
											to stop this epidemic of appraisal fraud.
											And the appraisers explained how it was occurring,
											that banks were demanding that appraisers
											inflate the appraisal,
											and that if the appraisers refused to do so,
											they, the banks, would blacklist
											honest appraisers
											and refuse to use them.
											Now, we&#39;ve seen this before
											in the savings and loan debacle,
											and we know that this kind of fraud
											can only originate from the lenders,
											and that no honest lender would ever inflate
											the appraisal,
											because it&#39;s the great protection against loss.
											So this was an incredibly early warning, 2000.
											It was something we&#39;d seen before,
											and it was completely unambiguous.
											This was an epidemic of accounting control fraud
											led by the banks.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											What about liar&#39;s loans?
											Well, that warning actually comes earlier.
											The savings and loan debacle is basically
											the early 1980s through 1993,
											and in the midst of fighting that wave
											of accounting control fraud,
											in 1990, we found that a second front
											of fraud was being started.
											And like all good financial frauds in America,
											it began in Orange County, California.
											And we happened to be the regional regulators for it.
											And our examiners said,
											they are making loans without even checking
											what the borrower&#39;s income is.
											This is insane, it has to lead to massive losses,
											and it only makes sense for entities engaged
											in these accounting control frauds.
											And we said, yeah, you&#39;re absolutely right,
											and we drove those liar&#39;s loans
											out of the industry in 1990 and 1991,
											but we could only deal with the industry
											we had jurisdiction over,
											which was savings and loans,
											and so the biggest and the baddest of the frauds,
											Long Beach Savings, voluntarily gave up
											its federal savings and loan charter,
											gave up federal deposit insurance,
											converted to become a mortgage bank
											for the sole purpose of escaping our jurisdiction,
											and changed its name to Ameriquest,
											and became the most notorious
											of the liar&#39;s loans frauds early on,
											and to add to that,
											they deliberately predated upon minorities.

								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So we knew again about this crisis.
											We&#39;d seen it before. We&#39;d stopped it before.
											We had incredibly early warnings of it,
											and it was absolutely unambiguous
											that no honest lender would
make loans in this fashion.
											So let&#39;s take a look at the reaction
											of the industry and the regulators
											and the prosecutors to these clear
											early warnings that could have prevented the crisis.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Start with the industry.
											The industry responded between 2003 and 2006
											by increasing liar&#39;s loans
											by over 500 percent.
											These were the loans
											that hyperinflated the bubble
											and produced the economic crisis.
											By 2006, half of all the loans called subprime
											were also liar&#39;s loans.
											They&#39;re not mutually exclusive, it&#39;s just that together,
											they&#39;re the most toxic combination
											you can possibly imagine.
											By 2006, 40 percent of all the loans
											made that year, all the home loans made that year,
											were liar&#39;s loans,
											40 percent.
											And this is despite a warning
											from the industry&#39;s own antifraud experts
											that said that these loans were an open invitation
											to fraudsters,
											and that they had a fraud incidence
											of 90 percent,
											nine zero.
											In response to that, the industry
											first started calling these loans liar&#39;s loans,
											which lacks a certain subtlety,
											and second, massively increased them,
											and no government regulator ever
											required or encouraged any lender
											to make a liar&#39;s loan
											or anyone to purchase a liar&#39;s loan,
											and that explicitly includes Fannie and Freddie.
											This came from the lenders
											because of the fraud recipe.

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											What happened to appraisal fraud?
											It expanded remarkably as well.
											By 2007, when a survey of appraisers was done,
											90 percent of appraisers reported
											that they had been subject to coercion
											from the lenders trying to get them
											to inflate an appraisal.
											In other words, both forms of fraud
											became absolutely endemic and normal,
											and this is what drove the bubble.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											What happened in the governmental sector?
											Well, the government, as I told you,
											when we were the savings and loan regulators,
											we could only deal with our industry,
											and if people gave up their
federal deposit insurance,
											we couldn&#39;t do anything to them.
											Congress, it may strike you as impossible,
											but actually did something intelligent in 1994,
											and passed the Home Ownership
and Equity Protection Act
											that gave the Fed, and only the Federal Reserve,
											the explicit, statutory authority to ban liar&#39;s loans
											by every lender,
											whether or not they had federal deposit insurance.
											So what did Ben Bernanke and Alan Greenspan,
											as chairs of the Fed, do
											when they got these warnings
											that these were massively fraudulent loans
											and that they were being sold
to the secondary market?
											Remember, there&#39;s no fraud exorcist.
											Once it starts out a fraudulent loan,
											it can only be sold to the secondary market
											through more frauds,
											lying about the reps and warrantees,
											and then those people are going to produce
											mortgage-backed securities
											and exotic derivatives
											which are also going to be supposedly backed
											by those fraudulent loans.
											So the fraud is going to progress
											through the entire system,
											hyperinflate the bubble, produce a disaster.
											And remember, we had experience with this.
											We had seen significant losses,
											and we had experience of competent regulators
											in stopping it.
											Greenspan and Bernanke refused
											to use the authority under the statute
											to stop liar&#39;s loans.
											And this was a matter first of dogma.
											They&#39;re just horrifically opposed
											to anything regulatory.
											But it is also the international competition in laxity,
											the race to the bottom
											between the United States and the United Kingdom,
											the city of London, in particular,
											and the city of London won that race to the bottom,
											but it meant that all regulation in the West
											was completely degraded
											in this stupid competition to be
											who could have the weakest regulation.

								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So that was the regulatory response.
											What about the response of the prosecutors
											after the crisis,
											after 11 trillion dollars in losses,
											after 10 million jobs lost,
											a crisis in which the losses and the frauds
											were more than 70 times larger
											than the savings and loan debacle?
											Well, in the savings and loan debacle,
											our agency that regulated savings and loans, OTS,
											made over 30,000 criminal referrals,
											produced over 1,000 felony convictions
											just in cases designated as major,
											and that understates the degree of prioritization,
											because we worked with the FBI
											to create the list of the top 100 fraud schemes,
											the absolute worst of the worst, nationwide.
											Roughly 300 savings and loans involved,
											roughly 600 senior officials.
											Virtually all of them were prosecuted.
											We had a 90 percent conviction rate.
											It&#39;s the greatest success against
											elite white collar criminals ever,
											and it was because of this understanding
											of control fraud
											and the accounting control fraud mechanism.

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Flash forward to the current crisis.
											The same agency, Office of Thrift Supervision,
											which was supposed to regulate
											many of the largest makers of liar&#39;s loans
											in the country,
											has made, even today — it no longer exists,
											but as of a year ago,
											it had made zero criminal referrals.
											The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency,
											which is supposed to regulate
the largest national banks,
											has made zero criminal referrals.
											The Fed appears to have made
											zero criminal referrals.
											The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
											is smart enough to refuse to answer the question.
											Without any guidance from the regulators,
											there&#39;s no expertise in the FBI
											to investigate complex frauds.
											It isn&#39;t simply that they&#39;ve had
											to reinvent the wheel
											of how to do these prosecutions;
											they&#39;ve forgotten that the wheel exists,
											and therefore, we have zero prosecutions,
											and of course, zero convictions,
											of any of the elite bank frauds,
											the Wall Street types,
											that drove this crisis.
									</p>
								</div>

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											With no expertise coming from the regulators,
											the FBI formed what it calls a partnership
											with the Mortgage Bankers Association in 2007.
											The Mortgage Bankers Association
											is the trade association of the perps.
											And the Mortgage Bankers Association
											set out, it had the audacity and the success
											to con the FBI.
											It had created a supposed definition
											of mortgage fraud, in which, guess what,
											its members are always the victim
											and never the perpetrators.
											And the FBI has bought this hook, line, sinker,
											rod, reel and the boat they rode out in.
											And so the FBI,
											under the leadership of an attorney general
											who is African-American
											and a president of the United
States who is African-American,
											have adopted the Tea Party definition of the crisis,
											in which it is the first virgin crisis in history,
											conceived without sin in the executive ranks.
											And it&#39;s those oh-so-clever hairdressers
											who were able to defraud the poor, pitiful banks,
											who lack any financial sophistication.
											It is the silliest story you can conceive of,
											and so they go and they prosecute the hairdressers,
											and they leave the banksters alone entirely.
											And so, while lions are roaming the campsite,
											the FBI is chasing mice.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											What do we need to do?
											What can we do in all of this?
											We need to change the perverse incentive structures
											that produce these recurrent epidemics
											of accounting control fraud
											that are driving our crises.
											So we have to first get rid
											of the systemically dangerous institutions.
											These are the so-called too-big-to-fail institutions.
											We need to shrink them to the point,
											within the next five years,
											that they no longer pose a systemic risk.
											Right now, they are ticking time bombs
											that will cause a global crisis
											as soon as the next one fails —
											not if, when.
											Second thing we need to do is completely reform
											modern executive and professional compensation,
											which is what they use to suborn the appraisers.
											Remember, they were pressuring the appraisers
											through the compensation system,
											trying to produce what we call a Gresham&#39;s dynamic,
											in which bad ethics drives good ethics
											out of the marketplace.
											And they largely succeeded,
											which is how the fraud became endemic.
											And the third thing that we need to do
											is deal with what we call the three D&#39;s:
											deregulation, desupervision,
											and the de facto decriminalization.
											Because we can make
											all three of these changes, and if we do so,
											we can dramatically reduce
											how often we have a crisis
											and how severe those crises are.
											That is not simply critical to our economy.
											You can see what these crises do to inequality
											and what they do to our democracy.
											They have produced crony capitalism,
											American-style,
											in which the largest financial institutions
											are the leading financial donors of both parties,
											and that&#39;s the reason why
											even after this crisis,
											70 times larger than the savings and loan crisis,
											we have no meaningful reforms
											in any of the three areas that I&#39;ve talked about,
											other than banning liar&#39;s loans,
											which is good,
											but that&#39;s just one form of ammunition
											for this fraud weapon.
											There are many forms of ammunition they can use.
