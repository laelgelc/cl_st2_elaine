											Simone George: I met Mark
when he was just blind.
											I had returned home to live in Dublin
											after the odyssey that was my 20s,
											educating my interest in human rights
and equality in university,
											traveling the world,
like my nomad grandmother.
											And during a two-year stint
working in Madrid,
											dancing many nights
till morning in salsa clubs.
											When I met Mark, he asked me
to teach him to dance.
											And I did.

											They were wonderful times,
long nights talking,
											becoming friends
and eventually falling for each other.
											Mark had lost his sight when he was 22,
											and the man that I met eight years later
was rebuilding his identity,
											the cornerstone of which
was this incredible spirit
											that had taken him to the Gobi Desert,
where he ran six marathons in seven days.
											And to marathons at the North Pole,
and from Everest Base Camp.

											When I asked him what had led
to this high-octane life,
											he quoted Nietzsche:
											&quot;He, who has a Why to live,
can bear with almost any How.&quot;
											He had come across the quote
in a really beautiful book
											called &quot;Man&#39;s Search for Meaning,&quot;
by Viktor Frankl,
											a neurologist and psychiatrist
											who survived years
in a Nazi concentration camp.
											Frankl used this Nietzsche quote
to explain to us
											that when we can no longer change
our circumstances,
											we are challenged to change ourselves.

											Mark Pollock: Eventually,
I did rebuild my identity,
											and the Why for me
was about competing again,
											because pursuing success
and risking failure
											was simply how I felt normal.
											And I finished the rebuild
											on the 10th anniversary
of losing my sight.
											I took part in a 43-day expedition race
											in the coldest, most remote,
most challenging place on earth.
											It was the first race to the South Pole
											since Shackleton, Scott and Amundsen
set foot in Antarctica, 100 years before.
											And putting the demons
of blindness behind me
											with every step towards the pole,
											it offered me a long-lasting

											As it turned out,
I would need that in reserve,

											a bedroom at a friend&#39;s house,
											I fell from a third-story window
onto the concrete below.
											I don&#39;t know how it happened.
											I think I must have got up
to go to the bathroom.
											And because I&#39;m blind,
I used to run my hand along the wall
											to find my way.
											That night, my hand found an open space
where the closed window should have been.
											And I cartwheeled out.
											My friends who found me
thought I was dead.
											When I got to hospital,
the doctors thought I was going to die,
											and when I realized
what was happening to me,
											I thought that dying might have been ...
											might have been the best outcome.
											And lying in intensive care,
											facing the prospect
of being blind and paralyzed,
											high on morphine, I was trying
to make sense of what was going on.

											And one night, lying flat on my back,
											I felt for my phone to write a blog,
											trying to explain how I should respond.
											It was called &quot;Optimist, Realist
or Something Else?&quot;
											and it drew on the experiences
of Admiral Stockdale,
											who was a POW in the Vietnam war.
											He was incarcerated, tortured,
for over seven years.
											His circumstances were bleak,
but he survived.
											The ones who didn&#39;t survive
were the optimists.
											They said, &quot;We&#39;ll be out by Christmas,&quot;
											and Christmas would come
and Christmas would go,
											and then it would be Christmas again,
											and when they didn&#39;t get out,
they became disappointed, demoralized
											and many of them died in their cells.
											Stockdale was a realist.
											He was inspired by the stoic philosophers,
											and he confronted the brutal
facts of his circumstances
											while maintaining a faith
that he would prevail in the end.
											And in that blog, I was trying to apply
his thinking as a realist

											SG: After I got the call,
I caught the first flight to England
											and arrived into the brightly lit
intensive care ward,
											where Mark was lying naked,
just under a sheet,
											connected to machines
that were monitoring if he would live.
											I said, &quot;I&#39;m here, Mark.&quot;
											And he cried tears he seemed
to have saved just for me.
											I wanted to gather him in my arms,
but I couldn&#39;t move him,
											and so I kissed him
the way you kiss a newborn baby,
											terrified of their fragility.
											Later that afternoon, when the bad news
had been laid out for us —
											fractured skull, bleeds on his brain,
a possible torn aorta
											and a spine broken in two places,
no movement or feeling below his waist —
											Mark said to me, &quot;Come here.
											You need to get yourself
as far away from this as possible.&quot;

of what it means to be human.
											And it had turned me from my upright,
standing, running form,

											And it&#39;s not just the lack
of feeling and movement.
											Paralysis also interferes
with the body&#39;s internal systems,
											which are designed to keep us alive.
											Multiple infections, nerve pain,
spasms, shortened life spans are common.

											Over 16 months in hospital,
											Simone and I were presented
with the expert view
											that hoping for a cure had proven
to be psychologically damaging.
											It was like the formal medical system
was canceling hope
											in favor of acceptance alone.
											But canceling hope ran contrary
to everything that we believed in.
											Yes, up to this point in history,
											it had proven to be impossible
to find a cure for paralysis,

of the impossible made possible
											through human endeavor.
											The kind of human endeavor
that took explorers to the South Pole
											at the start of the last century.
											And the kind of human endeavor
											that will take adventurers to Mars

											SG: Well, we really believed that it can.
											My research taught us
											that we needed to remind
Mark&#39;s damaged and dormant spinal cord
											of its upright, standing, running form,
											and we found San Francisco-based
engineers at Ekso Bionics,
											who created this robotic exoskeleton
that would allow Mark to stand and walk
											in the lab that we started
to build in Dublin.
											Mark became the first person
to personally own an exo,

											It was bit of an early celebration,
because actually it wasn&#39;t enough,
											the robot was doing all of the work,
											so we needed to plug Mark in.
											So we connected
the San Francisco engineers
											with a true visionary in UCLA,
Dr. Reggie Edgerton,
											the most beautiful man
											and his team&#39;s life work had resulted
in a scientific breakthrough.
											Using electrical stimulation
of the spinal cord,
											a number of subjects
have been able to stand,
											and because of that,
regain some movement and feeling
											and most importantly,
											to regain some of the body&#39;s
internal functions
											that are designed to keep us alive
and to make that life a pleasure.
											Electrical stimulation of the spinal cord,
											we think, is the first meaningful
therapy ever for paralyzed people.

											when we&#39;re busy creating
groundbreaking scientific research,
											they hadn&#39;t quite yet got together.
											That seemed to be our job now.
											So we created our first collaboration,
											and the moment when we combined
											the electrical stimulation
of Mark&#39;s spinal cord,

plugs the mini arc reactor into his chest

											But if you remember
the blog that I mentioned,
											it posed a question
of how we should respond,
											optimist, realist or something else?
											And I think we have come to understand
that the optimists rely on hope alone
											and they risk being
disappointed and demoralized.
											The realists, on the other hand,
											they accept the brutal facts
and they keep hope alive, as well.
											The realists have managed to resolve
the tension between acceptance and hope
											by running them in parallel.
											And that&#39;s what Simone and I
have been trying to do
											over the last number of years.

											Look, I accept the wheelchair —
											I mean, it&#39;s almost impossible not to.
											And we&#39;re sad, sometimes,
for what we&#39;ve lost.
											I accept that I, and other wheelchair
users, can and do live fulfilling lives,
											despite the nerve pain
and the spasms and the infections
											and the shortened life spans.
											And I accept that it is way more difficult
											for people who are paralyzed
from the neck down.
											For those who rely
on ventilators to breathe,
											and for those who don&#39;t have access
to adequate, free health care.
											So, that is why we also hope
for another life.
											A life where we have created a cure
through collaboration.
											A cure that we are actively working
to release from university labs
											around the world
											and share with everyone who needs it.

											SG: I met Mark when he was just blind.
											He asked me to teach him
to dance, and I did.
											One night, after dance classes,
											I turned to say goodnight
to him at his front door,
											and to his gorgeous guide dog, Larry.
											I realized, that in switching
all the lights off in the apartment
											before I left,
											that I was leaving him in the dark.
											I burst into uncontrollable tears
and tried to hide it, but he knew.
											And he hugged me and said,
											&quot;Ah, poor Simone.
											You&#39;re back in 1998, when I went blind.
											Don&#39;t worry, it turns out OK in the end.&quot;

											Acceptance is knowing
that grief is a raging river.

George was also active in the campaigns for marriage equality and reproductive rights in Ireland.

Even when I was just blind, facing into the extreme situation of my own choosing -- a race to the South Pole -- this story instantly spoke to me. I have since read the stoic philosophers, but the Admiral Stockdale conversation is what I return to when I need reminding, in particular this part where Jim Collins writes: \"Then he [Stockdale] grabbed me by the shoulders and he said, 'This is what I learned from those years in the prison camp, where all those constraints just were oppressive. You must never, ever, ever confuse, on the one hand, the need for absolute, unwavering faith that you can prevail despite those constraints with, on the other hand, the need for the discipline to begin by confronting the brutal facts, whatever they are.

They are not set systems incapable of change and adaptation, which had been a scientific certainty until then, and how this scientific certainty had held up much of the ground breaking research happening now.

He also won silver and bronze medals for rowing at the Commonwealth Games and set up a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.markpollock.com/\" target=\"_blank\">motivational speaking business</a>.</p><p>In 2010, Pollock was left paralysed after falling from a third story window.

Through the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.markpollocktrust.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Mark Pollock Trust</a>, he&#39;s unlocking $1 billion to cure paralysis in our lifetime.</p><p>Selected by the World Economic Forum as a Young Global Leader and appointed to the Global Futures Council on Human Enhancement, Pollock is a UBS Global Visionary, is on the Board of the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation and is a Wings for Life Ambassador. With his fianc&eacute;e, Simone George, he is the subject of the acclaimed documentary called&nbsp;<a href=\"https://vimeo.com/137502216\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Unbreakable</em></a>, and is a TED, Davos, World Economic Forum, InnoTown, F.ounders, EG and Wired speaker.

Simone believes that the system isn&#39;t broken but built this way -- and that getting to justice requires advocates to be more courageous on behalf of those they represent.</p><p>Using a principle-based approach to her work, George co-authored the national study, &quot;The lawlessness of the home,&quot; co-created an international summit in 2016 to cultivate the leadership required to the system and contributed to amendments to domestic violence legislation that is now a significant statement of legal, social and political justice in Ireland. George was also active in the campaigns for marriage equality and reproductive rights in Ireland. When the Pope came to Ireland in August 2018, George, together with a flying column of activists, created Stand For Truth, an alternative space to stand in solidarity with those abused by the church.&nbsp;</p><p>Building on her legal training that began with law degrees from NUI Galway and a Master&#39;s from the College of Europe, Bruges, George went on to create public-private partnerships across Africa for BP Solar.

Her research, which began by Pollock&#39;s hospital bed, became the start of their next adventure -- to cure paralysis in our lifetime.
