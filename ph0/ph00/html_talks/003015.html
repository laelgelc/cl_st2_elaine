<title>iO Tillett Wright: Fifty shades of gay | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: iO Tillett Wright has photographed 2,000 people who consider themselves somewhere on the LGBTQ spectrum -- and asked many of them: Can you assign a percentage to how gay or straight you are? Most people, it turns out, consider themselves to exist in the gray areas of sexuality, not 100% gay or straight. Which presents a real problem when it comes to discrimination: Where do you draw the line?" />

<meta content='iO Tillett Wright has photographed 2,000 people who consider themselves somewhere on the LGBTQ spectrum — and asked many of them: Can you assign a percentage to how gay or straight you are? Most people, it turns out, consider themselves to exist in the gray areas of sexuality, not 100% gay or straight. Which presents a real problem when it comes to discrimination: Where do you draw the line?' itemprop='description'>

											Human beings start putting each other into boxes
											the second that they see each other —
											Is that person dangerous? Are they attractive?
											Are they a potential mate? Are they a potential networking opportunity?
											We do this little interrogation when we meet people
											to make a mental resume for them.
											What&#39;s your name? Where are you from?
											How old are you? What do you do?
											Then we get more personal with it.
											Have you ever had any diseases?
											Have you ever been divorced?
											Does your breath smell bad while you&#39;re answering my interrogation right now?
											What are you into? Who are you into?
											What gender do you like to sleep with?

											I get it.
											We are neurologically hardwired
											to seek out people like ourselves.
											We start forming cliques as soon as we&#39;re old enough
											to know what acceptance feels like.
											We bond together based on anything that we can —
											music preference, race, gender, the block that we grew up on.
											We seek out environments that reinforce our personal choices.
											Sometimes, though, just the question &quot;what do you do?&quot;
											can feel like somebody&#39;s opening a tiny little box
											and asking you to squeeze yourself inside of it.
											Because the categories, I&#39;ve found, are too limiting.
											The boxes are too narrow.
											And this can get really dangerous.

									<p>
											So here&#39;s a disclaimer about me, though,
											before we get too deep into this.
											I grew up in a very sheltered environment.
											I was raised in downtown Manhattan in the early 1980s,
											two blocks from the epicenter of punk music.
											I was shielded from the pains of bigotry
											and the social restrictions of a religiously-based upbringing.
											Where I come from, if you weren&#39;t a drag queen or a radical thinker
											or a performance artist of some kind,
											you were the weirdo.
											(Laughter)
											It was an unorthodox upbringing,
											but as a kid on the streets of New York,
											you learn how to trust your own instincts,
											you learn how to go with your own ideas.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So when I was six, I decided that I wanted to be a boy.
											I went to school one day and the kids wouldn&#39;t let me play basketball with them.
											They said they wouldn&#39;t let girls play.
											So I went home, and I shaved my head,
											and I came back the next day and I said, &quot;I&#39;m a boy.&quot;
											I mean, who knows, right?
											When you&#39;re six, maybe you can do that.
											I didn&#39;t want anyone to know that I was a girl, and they didn&#39;t.
											I kept up the charade for eight years.

											So this is me when I was 11.
											I was playing a kid named Walter
											in a movie called &quot;Julian Po.&quot;
											I was a little street tough that followed Christian Slater around and badgered him.
											See, I was also a child actor,
											which doubled up the layers of the performance of my identity,
											because no one knew that I was actually a girl really playing a boy.
											In fact, no one in my life knew that I was a girl —
											not my teachers at school, not my friends,
											not the directors that I worked with.
											Kids would often come up to me in class
											and grab me by the throat to check for an Adam&#39;s apple
											or grab my crotch to check what I was working with.
											When I would go to the bathroom, I would turn my shoes around in the stalls
											so that it looked like I was peeing standing up.
											At sleepovers I would have panic attacks
											trying to break it to girls that they didn&#39;t want to kiss me
											without outing myself.

											It&#39;s worth mentioning though
											that I didn&#39;t hate my body or my genitalia.
											I didn&#39;t feel like I was in the wrong body.
											I felt like I was performing this elaborate act.
											I wouldn&#39;t have qualified as transgender.
											If my family, though, had been the kind of people to believe in therapy,
											they probably would have diagnosed me
											as something like gender dysmorphic
											and put me on hormones to stave off puberty.
											But in my particular case,
											I just woke up one day when I was 14,
											and I decided that I wanted to be a girl again.
											Puberty had hit, and I had no idea what being a girl meant,
											and I was ready to figure out who I actually was.

									<p>
											When a kid behaves like I did,
											they don&#39;t exactly have to come out, right?
											No one is exactly shocked.
											(Laughter)
											But I wasn&#39;t asked to define myself by my parents.
											When I was 15, and I called my father
											to tell him that I had fallen in love,
											it was the last thing on either of our minds
											to discuss what the consequences were
											of the fact that my first love was a girl.
											Three years later, when I fell in love with a man,
											neither of my parents batted an eyelash either.
											See, it&#39;s one of the great blessings of my very unorthodox childhood
											that I wasn&#39;t ever asked to define myself
											as any one thing at any point.
											I was just allowed to be me, growing and changing in every moment.

											So four, almost five years ago,
											Proposition 8, the great marriage equality debate,
											was raising a lot of dust around this country.
											And at the time, getting married wasn&#39;t really something
											I spent a lot of time thinking about.
											But I was struck by the fact that America,
											a country with such a tarnished civil rights record,
											could be repeating its mistakes so blatantly.
											And I remember watching the discussion on television
											and thinking how interesting it was
											that the separation of church and state
											was essentially drawing geographical boundaries throughout this country,
											between places where people believed in it
											and places where people didn&#39;t.
											And then, that this discussion was drawing geographical boundaries around me.

											If this was a war with two disparate sides,
											I, by default, fell on team gay,
											because I certainly wasn&#39;t 100 percent straight.
											At the time I was just beginning to emerge
											from this eight-year personal identity crisis zigzag
											that saw me go from being a boy
											to being this awkward girl that looked like a boy in girl&#39;s clothes
											to the opposite extreme of this super skimpy,
											over-compensating, boy-chasing girly-girl
											to finally just a hesitant exploration of what I actually was,
											a tomboyish girl
											who liked both boys and girls depending on the person.

											I had spent a year photographing this new generation of girls, much like myself,
											who fell kind of between-the-lines —
											girls who skateboarded but did it in lacy underwear,
											girls who had boys&#39; haircuts but wore girly nail polish,
											girls who had eyeshadow to match their scraped knees,
											girls who liked girls and boys who all liked boys and girls
											who all hated being boxed in to anything.
											I loved these people, and I admired their freedom,
											but I watched as the world outside of our utopian bubble
											exploded into these raging debates
											where pundits started likening our love to bestiality on national television.
											And this powerful awareness rolled in over me
											that I was a minority, and in my own home country,
											based on one facet of my character.
											I was legally and indisputably a second-class citizen.

											I was not an activist.
											I wave no flags in my own life.
											But I was plagued by this question:
											How could anyone vote to strip the rights
											of the vast variety of people that I knew
											based on one element of their character?
											How could they say that we as a group
											were not deserving of equal rights as somebody else?
											Were we even a group? What group?
											And had these people ever even consciously met a victim of their discrimination?
											Did they know who they were voting against and what the impact was?

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And then it occurred to me,
											perhaps if they could look into the eyes
											of the people that they were casting into second-class citizenship
											it might make it harder for them to do.
											It might give them pause.
											Obviously I couldn&#39;t get 20 million people to the same dinner party,
											so I figured out a way where I could introduce them to each other photographically
											without any artifice, without any lighting,
											or without any manipulation of any kind on my part.
											Because in a photograph you can examine a lion&#39;s whiskers
											without the fear of him ripping your face off.

											For me, photography is not just about exposing film,
											it&#39;s about exposing the viewer
											to something new, a place they haven&#39;t gone before,
											but most importantly, to people that they might be afraid of.
											Life magazine introduced generations of people
											to distant, far-off cultures they never knew existed through pictures.
											So I decided to make a series of very simple portraits,
											mugshots if you will.
											And I basically decided to photograph anyone in this country
											that was not 100 percent straight,
											which, if you don&#39;t know, is a limitless number of people.

											So after traveling and talking to people
											in places like Oklahoma or small-town Texas,

											Visibility really is key.
											Familiarity really is the gateway drug to empathy.
											Once an issue pops up in your own backyard or amongst your own family,
											you&#39;re far more likely to explore sympathy for it
											or explore a new perspective on it.
											Of course, in my travels I met people
											who legally divorced their children for being other than straight,

											Once they got over the shock, though,
											by and large people opted for somewhere between 70 to 95 percent
											or the 3 to 20 percent marks.
											Of course, there were lots of people who opted for a 100 percent one or the other,
											but I found that a much larger proportion of people
											identified as something that was much more nuanced.
											I found that most people fall on a spectrum of what I have come to refer to as &quot;Grey.&quot;

											Let me be clear though — and this is very important —
											in no way am I saying that preference doesn&#39;t exist.
											And I am not even going to address the issue of choice versus biological imperative,
											because if any of you happen to be of the belief
											that sexual orientation is a choice,
											I invite you to go out and try to be grey.
											I&#39;ll take your picture just for trying.
											(Laughter)
											What I am saying though is that human beings are not one-dimensional.
											The most important thing to take from the percentage system is this:
											If you have gay people over here
											and you have straight people over here,
											and while we recognize that most people identify
											as somewhere closer to one binary or another,
											there is this vast spectrum of people that exist in between.

									<p>
											And the reality that this presents is a complicated one.
											Because, for example, if you pass a law
											that allows a boss to fire an employee for homosexual behavior,
											where exactly do you draw the line?
											Is it over here, by the people who have had one or two heterosexual experiences so far?
											Or is it over here
											by the people who have only had one or two homosexual experiences thus far?
											Where exactly does one become a second-class citizen?

											Another interesting thing that I learned from my project and my travels
											is just what a poor binding agent sexual orientation is.
											After traveling so much and meeting so many people,
											let me tell you, there are just as many jerks and sweethearts
											and Democrats and Republicans and jocks and queens
											and every other polarization you can possibly think of
											within the LGBT community
											as there are within the human race.
											Aside from the fact that we play with one legal hand tied behind our backs,
											and once you get past the shared narrative of prejudice and struggle,
											just being other than straight
											doesn&#39;t necessarily mean that we have anything in common.

											So in the endless proliferation of faces that Self Evident Truths is always becoming,
											as it hopefully appears across more and more platforms,
											bus shelters, billboards, Facebook pages, screen savers,
											perhaps in watching this procession of humanity,
											something interesting and useful will begin to happen.
											Hopefully these categories, these binaries,
											these over-simplified boxes
											will begin to become useless and they&#39;ll begin to fall away.
											Because really, they describe nothing that we see
											and no one that we know and nothing that we are.
											What we see are human beings in all their multiplicity.
											And seeing them makes it harder to deny their humanity.
											At the very least I hope it makes it harder to deny their human rights.

											So is it me particularly
											that you would choose to deny the right to housing,
											the right to adopt children, the right to marriage,
											the freedom to shop here, live here, buy here?
											Am I the one that you choose to disown
											as your child or your brother or your sister or your mother or your father,
											your neighbor, your cousin, your uncle, the president,
											your police woman or the fireman?
											It&#39;s too late.
											Because I already am all of those things.
											We already are all of those things, and we always have been.
											So please don&#39;t greet us as strangers,
											greet us as your fellow human beings, period.

","whotheyare":"As a child actor, iO Tillett Wright turned his shoes around in the bathroom stall so that people would think he was a boy. As a teenager, he fell in love with both women and men. His life in the gray areas of gender and sexuality deeply inform his work as an artist. ","whylisten":"<p>iO Tillett Wright thanks his parents for not asking him to define himself as a child. His experience of growing up without having check boxes like &ldquo;female,&rdquo; &ldquo;male,&rdquo; &ldquo;gay&rdquo; or straight&rdquo; thoroughly infuses his art.</p>    <p>iO&rsquo;s photography can be seen regularly in two features in <em>The New York Times</em>: <a href=\"http://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/tag/notes-from-the-underground/\">Notes from the Underground</a> and <a href=\"http://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/tag/the-lowdown/\">The Lowdown</a>. He is also the creator of <a href=\"http://selfevidentproject.com/\">Self Evident Truths</a>&mdash;an ongoing project to document the wide variety of experiences in LGBTQ America. So far, he has photographed about 2,000 people for the project. His goal: 10,000 portraits and a nationwide rethinking of discriminatory laws.</p>    <p>iO had his first solo show at Fuse gallery in New York City in 2010, and exhibited his work at The Hole Gallery in early summer of 2012. He has published three books of photographs; <em><a href=\"http://www.pauwaupublications.com/pages/books/io-losemynumber.html\">Lose My Number</a></em>, <em><a href=\"http://dandydarling.blogspot.com/2011/04/new-book-kisser.html\">KISSER</a></em>, and <a href=\"http://www.darlingdays.com/335880-look-ma-no-hands\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Look Ma&rsquo;, No Hands</em></a>.
