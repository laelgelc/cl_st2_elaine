											So before I get started,
what I&#39;m going to do
											is I&#39;m going to clarify my goal for you,
											which is not to teach a game of Gotcha.
											Liespotters aren&#39;t those nitpicky kids,
											those kids in the back of the room
that are shouting, &quot;Gotcha! Gotcha!
											Your eyebrow twitched.
You flared your nostril.
											I watch that TV show &#39;Lie To Me.&#39;
I know you&#39;re lying.&quot;
											No, liespotters are armed
											with scientific knowledge
of how to spot deception.
											They use it to get to the truth,
											and they do what mature
leaders do everyday;
											they have difficult conversations
with difficult people,
											sometimes during very difficult times.
											And they start up that path
by accepting a core proposition,
											and that proposition is the following:
											Lying is a cooperative act.
											Think about it, a lie has no power
whatsoever by its mere utterance.
											Its power emerges
											when someone else agrees
to believe the lie.

									<p>
											So I know it may sound like tough love,
											but look, if at some point
you got lied to,
											it&#39;s because you agreed to get lied to.
											Truth number one about lying:
Lying&#39;s a cooperative act.
											Now not all lies are harmful.
											Sometimes we&#39;re willing
participants in deception
											for the sake of social dignity,
											maybe to keep a secret that should
be kept secret, secret.
											We say, &quot;Nice song.&quot;
											&quot;Honey, you don&#39;t look fat in that, no.&quot;
											Or we say, favorite of the digiratti,
											&quot;You know, I just fished
that email out of my Spam folder.

											But there are times when we are unwilling
participants in deception.
											And that can have dramatic costs for us.
											Last year saw 997 billion dollars
											in corporate fraud alone
in the United States.
											That&#39;s an eyelash
under a trillion dollars.
											That&#39;s seven percent of revenues.
											Deception can cost billions.
											Think Enron, Madoff, the mortgage crisis.
											Or in the case
of double agents and traitors,
											like Robert Hanssen or Aldrich Ames,
											lies can betray our country,
											they can compromise our security,
they can undermine democracy,
											they can cause the deaths
of those that defend us.

											Deception is actually serious business.
											This con man, Henry Oberlander,
he was such an effective con man,
											British authorities say
											he could have undermined the entire
banking system of the Western world.
											And you can&#39;t find this guy on Google;
you can&#39;t find him anywhere.
											He was interviewed once,
and he said the following.
											He said, &quot;Look, I&#39;ve got one rule.&quot;
											And this was Henry&#39;s rule, he said,
											&quot;Look, everyone is willing
to give you something.
											They&#39;re ready to give you something
for whatever it is they&#39;re hungry for.&quot;
											And that&#39;s the crux of it.
											If you don&#39;t want to be
deceived, you have to know,
											what is it that you&#39;re hungry for?

											And we all kind of hate to admit it.
											We wish we were
better husbands, better wives,
											smarter, more powerful, taller, richer —
											the list goes on.
											Lying is an attempt to bridge that gap,
											to connect our wishes and our fantasies
											about who we wish we were,
how we wish we could be,
											with what we&#39;re really like.
											And boy are we willing to fill in
those gaps in our lives with lies.

											On a given day, studies show
that you may be lied to

											Now when we first hear
this data, we recoil.
											We can&#39;t believe how prevalent lying is.
											We&#39;re essentially against lying.
											But if you look more closely,
the plot actually thickens.
											We lie more to strangers
than we lie to coworkers.
											Extroverts lie more than introverts.
											Men lie eight times more about themselves
than they do other people.
											Women lie more to protect other people.
											If you&#39;re an average married couple,
											you&#39;re going to lie to your spouse
in one out of every 10 interactions.
											Now, you may think that&#39;s bad.

											Lying&#39;s complex.

of our daily and our business lives.

											We parse it out on an as-needed basis,
											sometimes for very good reasons,
											other times just because
we don&#39;t understand the gaps in our lives.
											That&#39;s truth number two about lying.
											We&#39;re against lying,
											but we&#39;re covertly for it
											in ways that our society has sanctioned
for centuries and centuries and centuries.

											Pamela Meyer: Okay,
what were the telltale signs?
											Well first we heard what&#39;s known
as a non-contracted denial.
											Studies show that people
who are overdetermined in their denial
											will resort to formal rather
than informal language.
											We also heard
distancing language: &quot;that woman.&quot;
											We know that liars will unconsciously
distance themselves
											from their subject,
											using language as their tool.
											Now if Bill Clinton had said,
&quot;Well, to tell you the truth ...&quot;
											or Richard Nixon&#39;s favorite,
&quot;In all candor ...&quot;
											he would have been a dead giveaway
											for any liespotter that knows
											that qualifying language, as it&#39;s called,
qualifying language like that,
											further discredits the subject.
											Now if he had repeated
the question in its entirety,
											or if he had peppered his account
with a little too much detail —
											and we&#39;re all really glad
he didn&#39;t do that —
											he would have further discredited himself.

											Now this brings us to our next pattern,

											With body language,
here&#39;s what you&#39;ve got to do.
											You&#39;ve really got to just throw
your assumptions out the door.
											Let the science temper
your knowledge a little bit.

fidget all the time.
											Well guess what, they&#39;re known to freeze
their upper bodies when they&#39;re lying.

you in the eyes a little too much

											We think warmth and smiles
convey honesty, sincerity.

can spot a fake smile a mile away.

											Now let&#39;s say you&#39;re having
that exact same conversation
											with someone deceptive.
											That person may be withdrawn,

											Ask a deceptive person

											PM: Okay, those head shakes
are much easier to spot
											once you know to look for them.
											There are going to be times
when someone makes one expression
											while masking another that just
kind of leaks through in a flash.
											Murderers are known to leak sadness.
											Your new joint venture partner
might shake your hand,
											celebrate, go out to dinner with you
and then leak an expression of anger.
											And we&#39;re not all going to become
facial expression experts overnight here,
											but there&#39;s one I can teach you
that&#39;s very dangerous
											and it&#39;s easy to learn,
											and that&#39;s the expression of contempt.
											Now with anger, you&#39;ve got
two people on an even playing field.
											It&#39;s still somewhat
of a healthy relationship.
											But when anger turns to contempt,
you&#39;ve been dismissed.
											It&#39;s associated with moral superiority.
											And for that reason, it&#39;s very,
very hard to recover from.
											Here&#39;s what it looks like.
											It&#39;s marked by one lip corner
pulled up and in.
											It&#39;s the only asymmetrical expression.
											And in the presence of contempt,
whether or not deception follows —
											and it doesn&#39;t always follow —
											look the other way,
go the other direction,
											reconsider the deal,
											say, &quot;No thank you. I&#39;m not coming up
for just one more nightcap. Thank you.&quot;

many, many more indicators.

If it&rsquo;s not your words that give you away, it&rsquo;s your posture, eyes, breathing rate, fidgets, and a host of other indicators. Worse, we are all lied to up to 200 times a day, she says, from the white lies that allow society to function smoothly to the devastating duplicities that bring down corporations and break up families. <br /><br />Working with a team of researchers over several years, Meyer, who is CEO of social networking company Simpatico Networks, collected and reviewed most of the research on deception that has been published, from such fields as law-enforcement, military, psychology and espionage. She then became an expert herself, receiving advanced training in deception detection, including multiple courses of advanced training in interrogation, microexpression analysis, statement analysis, behavior and body language interpretation, and emotion recognition. Her research is synthetized in her bestselling book Liespotting."}],"speaker_name":"Pamela Meyer","tags":["culture","psychology","science","society"],"title":"How to spot a liar","video_type":{"id":"1","name":"TED Stage Talk"},"viewed_count":26269772}]}})</script></div>
