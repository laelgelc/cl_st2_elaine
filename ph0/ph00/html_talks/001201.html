<title>Anjali Kumar: My failed mission to find God -- and what I found instead | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Anjali Kumar went looking for God and ended up finding something else entirely. In an uplifting, funny talk about our shared humanity, she takes us on a spiritual pilgrimage to meet witches in New York, a shaman in Peru, an infamous &quot;healer&quot; in Brazil and others, sharing an important lesson: what binds us together is far stronger than what separates us, and our differences are not insurmountable." />

											A few years ago,
											I set out on a mission to find God.
											Now, I&#39;m going to tell you
right up front that I failed,
											which, as a lawyer,
											is a really hard thing for me to admit.
											But on that failed journey,
											a lot of what I found was enlightening.
											And one thing in particular
gave me a lot of hope.
											It has to do with the magnitude
and significance of our differences.

											So, I was raised in America
by Indian parents — culturally Hindu,
											but practicing a strict and relatively
unknown religion outside of India
											called Jainism.
											To give you an idea
of just how minority that makes me:
											people from India represent
roughly one percent of the US population;
											Hindus, about 0.7 percent;
											Jains, at most .00046 percent.
											To put that in context:
											more people visit the Vermont
Teddy Bear Factory each year
											than are followers
of the Jain religion in America.
											To add to my minority mix,
my parents then decided,

											At the Infant Jesus of Prague School
in Flossmoor, Illinois —
											yes, that&#39;s really what it was called —
											we were taught to believe
that there is a single Supreme Being
											who is responsible for everything,
											the whole shebang,
											from the creation of the Universe
to moral shepherding to eternal life.
											But at home,
											I was being taught something
entirely different.
											Followers of the Jain religion
											don&#39;t believe in a single Supreme Being
											or even a team of Supreme Beings.
											Instead, we&#39;re taught that God manifests
											as the perfection of each of us
as individuals,
											and that we&#39;re actually
spending our entire lives
											striving to remove the bad karmas
											that stand in the way of us
becoming our own godlike, perfect selves.
											On top of that, one of the core
principles of Jainism
											is something called &quot;non-absolutism.&quot;
											Non-absolutists believe
that no single person
											can hold ownership or knowledge
of absolute truth,
											even when it comes to religious beliefs.
											Good luck testing that concept out
											on the priests and nuns
in your Catholic school.

											No wonder I was confused
											and hyperaware of how different
I was from my peers.
											Cut to 20-something years later,
											and I found myself to be
a highly spiritual person,
											but I was floundering.
											I was spiritually homeless.
											I came to learn that I was a &quot;None,&quot;
											which isn&#39;t an acronym
or a clever play on words,
											nor is it one of these.
											It&#39;s simply the painfully uninspired name
											given to everyone

											Now, a couple of interesting
things about Nones are:
											there are a lot of us,
											and we skew young.
											In 2014, there were over 56 million
religiously unaffiliated Nones
											in the United States.
											And Nones account
for over one-third of adults
											between the ages of 18 to 33.
											But the most interesting thing
to me about Nones
											is that we&#39;re often spiritual.
											In fact, 68 percent of us believe,
with some degree of certainty,
											that there is a God.
											We&#39;re just not sure who it is.

											So the first takeaway for me
											when I realized I was a None
and had found that information out
											was that I wasn&#39;t alone.
											I was finally part of a group in America
											that had a lot of members,
											which felt really reassuring.
											But then the second,
not-so-reassuring takeaway
											was that, oh, man, there are a lot of us.
											That can&#39;t be good,
											because if a lot of highly spiritual
people are currently godless,
											maybe finding God is not going to be
as easy as I had originally hoped.

											So that is when I decided
that on my spiritual journey,
											I was going to avoid the obvious places
											and skip the big-box religions altogether
											and instead venture out
into the spiritual fringe
											of mediums
											and faith healers
											and godmen.
											But remember, I&#39;m a non-absolutist,
											which means I was pretty inclined
to keep a fairly open mind,
											which turned out to be a good thing,
											because I went to a witch&#39;s potluck dinner
											at the LGBT Center in New York City,
											where I befriended two witches;
											drank a five-gallon jerrican

											Very early in my quest,

											Now, John of God is considered
a full-trance medium,

he can talk to dead people.

to channel a very specific group
											of dead saints and doctors
											in order to heal
whatever&#39;s wrong with you.
											And although John of God does
not have a medical degree
											or even a high school diploma,
											he actually performs surgery —
											the real kind, with a scalpel,
											but no anesthesia.
											Yeah, I don&#39;t know.
											He also offers invisible surgery,
where there is no cutting,
											and surrogate surgery,
											where he supposedly can treat somebody
who is thousands of miles away
											by performing a procedure on a loved one.

											In the weeks leading up
to my trip to Brazil,
											I mentioned my upcoming plans
to some friends
											and to a couple of colleagues at Google,
											where I was a lawyer at the time.
											And I might have mentioned it
to a couple more people
											because I&#39;m chatty,
											including my neighbor,
											the guy who works at the local
coffee shop I go to each morning,
											the checkout lady at Whole Foods
											and a stranger who sat
next to me on the subway.
											I told each of them where I was going
											and why,
											and I offered to carry three wishes
of theirs down to Brazil,
											explaining that anyone going
to see John of God
											could act as a proxy for others
											and save them the trip.
											And to my surprise, my in-box overflowed.
											Friends told friends who told friends,
											and those friends
apparently told more friends,
											other strangers
and the guys at their coffee shops,
											until it seemed that days
before I left for Brazil
											that there was no one who did not
have my email address.
											And at the time, all I could conclude
was that I had offered too much
											to too many.
											But when I actually reread
those messages a few years later,
											I noticed something completely different.
											Those emails actually shared
three commonalities,
											the first of which was rather curious.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Almost everyone sent me meticulous details
about how they could be reached.
											I had told them,
or their friends had told them,
											that along with the list
of the three things they wanted fixed,
											I needed their photo, their name
and their date of birth.
											But they gave me full addresses, with,
like, apartment numbers and zip codes,
											as if John of God was going
to stop by their house
											and see them in person
or send along a package.
											It was as if, in the highly unlikely event
that their wishes were granted
											by John of God,
											they just wanted to make sure
that they weren&#39;t delivered
											to the wrong person or the wrong address.
											Even if they didn&#39;t believe,
											they were hedging their bets.

											The second commonality
was just as curious,
											but far more humbling.
											Virtually everyone —
											the stranger on the subway,
											the guy at the coffee shop,
											the lawyer down the hall,
											the Jew, the atheist,
the Muslim, the devout Catholic —
											all asked for essentially
the same three things.
											OK, there were a couple of outliers,
and yes, a few people asked for cash.
											But when I eliminated what were
ultimately a handful of anomalies,
											the similarities were staggering.
											Almost every single person
											first asked for good health
for themselves and their families.
											Almost universally,
											they next asked for happiness
											and then love,
											in that order:
											health, happiness, love.
											Sometimes they asked for a specific
health issue to be fixed,
											but more often than not, they just
asked for good health in general.

of the basic human needs
											identified by social scientists
like Abraham Maslow and Manfred Max-Neef.
											No one asked for answers
to the big existential questions
											or for proof of God or the meaning of life
like I had set out to find.
											They didn&#39;t even ask for an end
to war or global hunger.
											Even when they could have asked
for absolutely anything,
											they all asked for health,
happiness and love.

											So now those emails had
a third commonality as well.
											Each of them ended in the exact same way.
											Instead of thanking me for carting
their wishes all the way to Brazil,
											everyone said,
											&quot;Please don&#39;t tell anyone.&quot;

											right here on this stage,
											not because I&#39;m untrustworthy,
											but because the fact
that we have so much in common
											feels especially important for us
all to hear, especially now,
											when so many of the world&#39;s problems

on the things that make us different,

											And look — I am the first to admit
that I am not a statistician,
											and that the data I presented to you
that I just accumulated in my in-box
											is more anecdotal than scientific,
more qualitative than quantitative.
											It is, as anyone who works
with data would tell you,
											hardly a statistically significant
or demographically balanced sample.
											But nonetheless, I find myself
thinking about those emails
											every time I reflect back
on the bias and prejudice
											that I&#39;ve faced in my life,
											or when there&#39;s another hate crime
or a senseless tragedy
											that underscores the disheartening sense
											that our differences
might be insurmountable.
											I then remind myself that I have evidence
											that the humbling, unifying commonality
											of our humanity
											is that, even when presented
with the opportunity
											to ask for anything at all,
											most of us want the same things,
											and that this is true
no matter who we are,
											what name we call our god,
											or which religion, if any, we call home.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											I then also note
											that apparently some of us
want these things so badly
											that we would email a None,
											a spiritually confused None like me —
											some might say otherwise
confused as well —
											and that we would seek out this stranger
and email her our deepest wishes,
											just in case there is
the remote possibility
											that they might be granted
by someone who is not a god,
											much less our god,
											someone who is not even
a member of our chosen religion,
											someone who, when you
look at him on paper,
											seems like an unlikely
candidate to deliver.

									<p>
											And so now,
											when I reflect back on my spiritual quest,
											even though I did not find God,
											I found a home in this:
											even today, in a world
fractured by religious,
											ethnic, political, philosophical,
and racial divides,
											even with all of our obvious differences,
											at the end of the day,
											and the most fundamental level,
											we are all the same.

I worked with a medium to convene with the dead, practiced transcendental and Vipassana meditation, witnessed a woman have a 45-minute orgasm during a sound healing session, tried laughing yoga and visited saints, goddesses, witches and faith healers.

Non-absolutism teaches that no single person can have ownership or knowledge of absolute truth. If you believe and practice anekāntavāda, you have no choice but to respect differences -- which leads to greater harmony.
