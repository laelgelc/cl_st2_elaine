											So, a big question that we&#39;re facing now
											and have been for quite a number of years now:
											are we at risk of a nuclear attack?
											Now, there&#39;s a bigger question
											that&#39;s probably actually more important than that,
											is the notion of permanently eliminating
											the possibility of a nuclear attack,
											eliminating the threat altogether.
											And I would like to make a case to you that
											over the years since we first developed atomic weaponry,
											until this very moment,
											we&#39;ve actually lived in a dangerous nuclear world
											that&#39;s characterized by two phases,
											which I&#39;m going to go through with you right now.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											First of all, we started off the nuclear age in 1945.
											The United States had developed a couple of atomic weapons
											through the Manhattan Project,
											and the idea was very straightforward:
											we would use the power of the atom
											to end the atrocities and the horror
											of this unending World War II
											that we&#39;d been involved in in Europe and in the Pacific.
											And in 1945,
											we were the only nuclear power.
											We had a few nuclear weapons,
											two of which we dropped on Japan, in Hiroshima,
											a few days later in Nagasaki, in August 1945,
											killing about 250,000 people between those two.
									</p>

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And for a few years,
											we were the only nuclear power on Earth.
											But by 1949, the Soviet Union had decided
											it was unacceptable to have us as the only nuclear power,
											and they began to match what the United States had developed.
											And from 1949 to 1985
											was an extraordinary time
											of a buildup of a nuclear arsenal
											that no one could possibly have imagined
											back in the 1940s.
											So by 1985 — each of those red bombs up here
											is equivalent of a thousands warheads —
											the world had
											65,000 nuclear warheads,
											and seven members of something
											that came to be known as the &quot;nuclear club.&quot;
									</p>
								</div>

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And it was an extraordinary time,
											and I am going to go through some of the mentality
											that we — that Americans and the rest of the world were experiencing.
											But I want to just point out to you that 95 percent
											of the nuclear weapons at any particular time
											since 1985 — going forward, of course —
											were part of the arsenals
											of the United States and the Soviet Union.
											After 1985, and before the break up of the Soviet Union,
											we began to disarm
											from a nuclear point of view.
											We began to counter-proliferate,
											and we dropped the number of nuclear warheads in the world
											to about a total of 21,000.
											It&#39;s a very difficult number to deal with,
											because what we&#39;ve done is
											we&#39;ve quote unquote &quot;decommissioned&quot; some of the warheads.
											They&#39;re still probably usable. They could be &quot;re-commissioned,&quot;
											but the way they count things, which is very complicated,
											we think we have about a third
											of the nuclear weapons we had before.
											But we also, in that period of time,
											added two more members to the nuclear club:
											Pakistan and North Korea.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So we stand today with a still fully armed nuclear arsenal
											among many countries around the world,
											but a very different set of circumstances.
											So I&#39;m going to talk about
											a nuclear threat story in two chapters.
											Chapter one is 1949 to 1991,
											when the Soviet Union broke up,
											and what we were dealing with, at that point and through those years,
											was a superpowers&#39; nuclear arms race.
											It was characterized by
											a nation-versus-nation,
											very fragile standoff.
											And basically,
											we lived for all those years,
											and some might argue that we still do,
											in a situation of
											being on the brink, literally,
											of an apocalyptic, planetary calamity.
											It&#39;s incredible that we actually lived through all that.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											We were totally dependent during those years
											on this amazing acronym, which is MAD.
											It stands for mutually assured destruction.
											So it meant
											if you attacked us, we would attack you
											virtually simultaneously,
											and the end result would be a destruction
											of your country and mine.
											So the threat of my own destruction
											kept me from launching
											a nuclear attack on you. That&#39;s the way we lived.
											And the danger of that, of course, is that
											a misreading of a radar screen
											could actually cause a counter-launch,
											even though the first country had not actually launched anything.
											During this chapter one,
											there was a high level of public awareness
											about the potential of nuclear catastrophe,
											and an indelible image was implanted
											in our collective minds
											that, in fact, a nuclear holocaust
											would be absolutely globally destructive
											and could, in some ways, mean the end of civilization as we know it.
											So this was chapter one.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now the odd thing is that even though
											we knew that there would be
											that kind of civilization obliteration,
											we engaged in America in a series —
											and in fact, in the Soviet Union —
											in a series of response planning.
											It was absolutely incredible.
											So premise one is we&#39;d be destroying the world,
											and then premise two is, why don&#39;t we get prepared for it?
											So what
											we offered ourselves
											was a collection of things. I&#39;m just going to go skim through a few things,
											just to jog your memories.
											If you&#39;re born after 1950, this is just —
											consider this entertainment, otherwise it&#39;s memory lane.

											This was Bert the Turtle. (Video)
											This was basically an attempt
											to teach our schoolchildren
											that if we did get engaged
											in a nuclear confrontation and atomic war,
											then we wanted our school children
											to kind of basically duck and cover.
											That was the principle. You —
											there would be a nuclear conflagration
											about to hit us, and if you get under your desk,
											things would be OK.

											Secondly, we told people
											to go down in their basements
											and build a fallout shelter.
											Maybe it would be a study when we weren&#39;t having an atomic war,
											or you could use it as a TV room, or, as many teenagers found out,
											a very, very safe place for a little privacy with your girlfriend.
											And actually — so there are multiple uses of the bomb shelters.
											Or you could buy a prefabricated bomb shelter
											that you could simply bury in the ground.
											Now, the bomb shelters at that point —
											let&#39;s say you bought a prefab one — it would be a few hundred dollars,
											maybe up to 500, if you got a fancy one.
											Yet, what percentage of Americans
											do you think ever had a bomb shelter in their house?
											What percentage lived in a house with a bomb shelter?

									<p>
											Less than two percent. About 1.4 percent
											of the population, as far as anyone knows,
											did anything,
											either making a space in their basement
											or actually building a bomb shelter.
											Many buildings, public buildings, around the country —
											this is New York City — had these little civil defense signs,
											and the idea was that you would
											run into one of these shelters and be safe
											from the nuclear weaponry.
											And one of the greatest governmental delusions
											of all time was something that happened
											in the early days of
											the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, as we now know,
											and are well aware of their behaviors from Katrina.
											Here is their first big public
											announcement.
											They would propose —
											actually there were about six volumes written on this —
											a crisis relocation plan
											that was dependent upon
											the United States having three to four days warning
											that the Soviets were going to attack us.
											So the goal was to evacuate the target cities.
											We would move people out of the target cities
											into the countryside.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And I&#39;m telling you, I actually testified at the Senate
											about the absolute ludicrous idea
											that we would actually evacuate,
											and actually have three or four days&#39; warning.
											It was just completely off the wall.
											Turns out that they had another idea
											behind it, even though this was —
											they were telling the public it was to save us.
											The idea was that we would force the Soviets
											to re-target their nuclear weapons — very expensive —
											and potentially double their arsenal,
											to not only take out the original site,
											but take out sites where people were going.
											This was what apparently, as it turns out, was behind all this.
											It was just really, really frightening.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											The main point here is we were dealing with
											a complete disconnect from reality.
											The civil defense programs were disconnected
											from the reality of what we&#39;d see in all-out nuclear war.
											So organizations like Physicians for Social Responsibility,
											around 1979, started saying this a lot publicly.
											They would do a bombing run. They&#39;d go to your city,
											and they&#39;d say, &quot;Here&#39;s a map of your city.
											Here&#39;s what&#39;s going to happen if we get a nuclear hit.&quot;
											So no possibility of medical response to,
											or meaningful preparedness for
											all-out nuclear war.
											So we had to prevent nuclear war
											if we expected to survive.
											This disconnect was never actually resolved.
											And what happened was —
											when we get in to chapter two
											of the nuclear threat era,
											which started back in 1945.

									<p>
											Chapter two starts in 1991.
											When the Soviet Union broke up,
											we effectively lost that adversary
											as a potential attacker of the United States, for the most part.
											It&#39;s not completely gone. I&#39;m going to come back to that.
											But from 1991
											through the present time,
											emphasized by the attacks of 2001,
											the idea of an all-out nuclear war
											has diminished and the idea of a single event,
											act of nuclear terrorism
											is what we have instead.
											Although the scenario has changed
											very considerably, the fact is
											that we haven&#39;t changed our mental image
											of what a nuclear war means.
											So I&#39;m going to tell you what the implications of that are in just a second.
											So, what is a nuclear terror threat?
											And there&#39;s four key ingredients to describing that.

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											First thing is that the global nuclear weapons,
											in the stockpiles that I showed you in those original maps,
											happen to be not uniformly secure.
											And it&#39;s particularly not secure
											in the former Soviet Union, now in Russia.
											There are many, many sites where warheads are stored
											and, in fact, lots of sites where fissionable materials,
											like highly enriched uranium and plutonium,
											are absolutely not safe.
											They&#39;re available to be bought, stolen, whatever.
											They&#39;re acquirable, let me put it that way.
											From 1993 through 2006,
											the International Atomic Energy Agency
											documented 175 cases of nuclear theft,
											18 of which involved highly enriched uranium or plutonium,
											the key ingredients to make a nuclear weapon.
											The global stockpile of highly enriched uranium
											is about 1,300, at the low end,
											to about 2,100 metric tons.
											More than 100 megatons of this
											is stored in particularly insecure
											Russian facilities.
											How much of that do you think it would take
											to actually build a 10-kiloton bomb?
											Well, you need about 75 pounds of it.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So, what I&#39;d like to show you
											is
											what it would take to hold 75 pounds
											of highly enriched uranium.
											This is not a product placement. It&#39;s just —
											in fact, if I was Coca Cola, I&#39;d be pretty distressed about this —
											(Laughter)
											— but
											basically, this is it.
									</p>
								</div>

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											This is what you would need to steal or buy
											out of that 100-metric-ton stockpile
											that&#39;s relatively insecure
											to create the type of bomb
											that was used in Hiroshima.
											Now you might want to look at plutonium
											as another fissionable material that you might use in a bomb.
											That — you&#39;d need 10 to 13 pounds of plutonium.
											Now, plutonium, 10 to 13 pounds:
											this. This is enough plutonium
											to create a Nagasaki-size atomic weapon.
											Now this situation, already I —
											you know, I don&#39;t really like thinking about this,
											although somehow I got myself a job
											where I have to think about it. So
											the point is that we&#39;re very, very insecure
											in terms of developing this material.
											The second thing is, what about the know-how?
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And there&#39;s a lot of controversy about
											whether terror organizations have the know-how
											to actually make a nuclear weapon.
											Well, there&#39;s a lot of know-how out there.
											There&#39;s an unbelievable amount of know-how out there.
											There&#39;s detailed information on how to assemble
											a nuclear weapon from parts.
											There&#39;s books about how to build a nuclear bomb.
											There are plans for how to create a terror farm
											where you could actually manufacture and develop
											all the components and assemble it.
											All of this information is relatively available.
											If you have an undergraduate degree in physics,
											I would suggest —
											although I don&#39;t, so maybe it&#39;s not even true —
											but something close to that would allow you,
											with the information that&#39;s currently available,
											to actually build a nuclear weapon.

									<p>
											The third element of the nuclear terror threat
											is that, who would actually do such a thing?
											Well, what we&#39;re seeing now is a level of terrorism
											that involves individuals who are highly organized.
											They are very dedicated and committed.
											They are stateless.
											Somebody once said, Al Qaeda
											does not have a return address,
											so if they attack us with a nuclear weapon,
											what&#39;s the response, and to whom is the response?
											And they&#39;re retaliation-proof.
											Since there is no real retribution possible
											that would make any difference,
											since there are people willing to actually give up their lives
											in order to do a lot of damage to us,
											it becomes apparent
											that the whole notion
											of this mutually assured destruction would not work.

											Here we go. OK.
											I&#39;m back in my truck, and we drove over the Brooklyn Bridge.
											We&#39;re coming down,
											and we bring that truck
											that you just saw
											somewhere in here, in the Financial District.
											This is a 10-kiloton bomb,
											slightly smaller than was used
											in Hiroshima. And I want to just conclude this
											by just giving you some information. I think —
											&quot;news you could use&quot; kind of concept here.
											So, first of all, this would be horrific
											beyond anything we can possibly imagine.
											This is the ultimate.
											And if you&#39;re in the half-mile radius
											of where this bomb went off,
											you have a 90 percent chance of not making it.
											If you&#39;re right where the bomb went off,
											you will be vaporized. And that&#39;s —
											I&#39;m just telling you, this is not good.

											You assume that.
											Two-mile radius, you have a 50 percent chance
											of being killed,
											and up to about eight miles away —
											now I&#39;m talking about killed instantly —
											somewhere between a 10 and 20 percent
											chance of getting killed.
											The thing about this is that
											the experience of the nuclear detonation is —
											first of all, tens of millions of degrees Fahrenheit
											at the core here, where it goes off,
											and an extraordinary amount of energy
											in the form of heat, acute radiation
											and blast effects.
											An enormous hurricane-like wind,
											and destruction of buildings almost totally,
											within this yellow circle here.
											And what I&#39;m going to focus on, as I come to conclusion here,
											is that, what happens to you
											if you&#39;re in here?
											Well, if we&#39;re talking about the old days
											of an all-out nuclear attack,
											you, up here,
											are as dead as the people here. So it was a moot point.
											My point now, though, is that there is a lot
											that we could do for you who are in here,
											if you&#39;ve survived the initial blast.
											You have, when the blast goes off —
											and by the way, if it ever comes up, don&#39;t look at it.

											If you look at it, you&#39;re going to be blind,
											either temporarily or permanently.
											So if there&#39;s any way that you can avoid,
											like, avert your eyes, that would be a good thing.
											If you find yourself alive, but
											you&#39;re in the vicinity of a nuclear weapon,
											you have — that&#39;s gone off —
											you have 10 to 20 minutes, depending on the size
											and exactly where it went off,
											to get out of the way before
											a lethal amount of radiation
											comes straight down from the mushroom cloud that goes up.
											In that 10 to 15 minutes, all you have to do —
											and I mean this seriously —
											is go about a mile
											away from the blast.
											And what happens is — this is —
											I&#39;m going to show you now some fallout plumes. Within 20 minutes,
											it comes straight down. Within 24 hours,
											lethal radiation is going out with prevailing winds,
											and it&#39;s mostly in this particular direction —
											it&#39;s going northeast.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And if you&#39;re in this vicinity, you&#39;ve got to get away.
											So you&#39;re feeling the wind —
											and there&#39;s tremendous wind now
											that you&#39;re going to be feeling — and you want to go
											perpendicular to the wind
											[not upwind or downwind].
											if you are in fact able to see where the blast was in front of you.
											You&#39;ve got to get out of there.
											If you don&#39;t get out of there, you&#39;re going to be exposed
											to lethal radiation in very short order.
											If you can&#39;t get out of there,
											we want you to go into a shelter and stay there.
											Now, in a shelter in an urban area means
											you have to be either in a basement as deep as possible,
											or you have to be on a floor — on a high floor —
											if it&#39;s a ground burst explosion, which it would be,
											higher than the ninth floor. So you have to be tenth floor or higher,
											or in the basement.
											But basically, you&#39;ve got to get out of town as quickly as possible.
											And if you do that,
											you actually can survive a nuclear blast.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Over the next few days to a week,
											there will be a radiation cloud,
											again, going with the wind, and settling down
											for another 15 or 20 miles out —
											in this case, over Long Island.
											And if you&#39;re in the direct fallout zone here,
											you really have to either be sheltered or you have to get out of there,
											and that&#39;s clear. But if you are sheltered,
											you can actually survive.
											The difference between knowing information
											of what you&#39;re going to do personally,
											and not knowing information, can save your life,
											and it could mean the difference between
											150,000 to 200,000 fatalities
											from something like this
											and half a million to 700,000 fatalities.

											So, response planning in the twenty-first century
											is both possible and is essential.
											But in 2008, there isn&#39;t one single American city
											that has done effective plans
											to deal with a nuclear detonation disaster.
											Part of the problem is that
											the emergency planners themselves, personally,
											are overwhelmed psychologically by the thought
											of nuclear catastrophe.
											They are paralyzed.
											You say &quot;nuclear&quot; to them, and they&#39;re thinking,
											&quot;Oh my God, we&#39;re all gone. What&#39;s the point? It&#39;s futile.&quot;
											And we&#39;re trying to tell them, &quot;It&#39;s not futile.
											We can change the survival rates
											by doing some commonsensical things.&quot;

									<p>
											So the goal here is to minimize fatalities.
											And I just want to leave you with the personal points
											that I think you might be interested in.
											The key to surviving a nuclear blast
											is getting out,
											and not going into harm&#39;s way.
											That&#39;s basically all we&#39;re going to be talking about here.
											And the farther you are away in distance,
											the longer it is in time
											from the initial blast;
											and the more separation between you
											and the outside atmosphere, the better.
											So separation — hopefully with dirt or concrete,
											or being in a basement —
											distance and time is what will save you.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So here&#39;s what you do. First of all,
											as I said, don&#39;t stare at the light flash,
											if you can. I don&#39;t know you could possibly resist doing that.
											But let&#39;s assume, theoretically, you want to do that.
											You want to keep your mouth open, so your eardrums
											don&#39;t burst from the pressures.
											If you&#39;re very close to what happened, you actually do have to duck and cover,
											like Bert told you, Bert the Turtle.
											And you want to get under something so that you&#39;re not injured
											or killed by objects, if that&#39;s at all possible.
											You want to get away from the initial fallout mushroom cloud,
											I said, in just a few minutes.
											And shelter and place. You want to move [only]
											crosswind for 1.2 miles.

									<p>
											You know, if you&#39;re out there and you see buildings horribly destroyed
											and down in that direction,
											less destroyed here,
											then you know that it was over there, the blast, and you&#39;re going this way,
											as long as you&#39;re going crosswise to the wind.
											Once you&#39;re out and evacuating,
											you want to keep as much of your skin,
											your mouth and nose covered, as long as that covering
											doesn&#39;t impede you moving and getting out of there.
											And finally, you want to get decontaminated as soon as possible.
											And if you&#39;re wearing clothing, you&#39;ve taken off your clothing,
											you&#39;re going to get showered down some place
											and remove the radiation that would be —
											the radioactive material that might be on you.
											And then you want to stay in shelter for 48 to 72 hours minimum,
											but you&#39;re going to wait hopefully — you&#39;ll have your little wind-up,
											battery-less radio,
											and you&#39;ll be waiting for people to tell you
											when it&#39;s safe to go outside. That&#39;s what you need to do.

											In conclusion,
											nuclear war is less likely than before,
											but by no means out of the question, and it&#39;s not survivable.
											Nuclear terrorism is possible — it may be probable —
											but is survivable.
											And this is Jack Geiger, who&#39;s one of the heroes
											of the U.S. public health community.
											And Jack said the only way to deal
											with nuclear anything,
											whether it&#39;s war or terrorism,
											is abolition of nuclear weapons.
											And you want something to work on once you&#39;ve fixed global warming,
											I urge you to think about the fact that
											we have to do something about this
											unacceptable, inhumane
											reality of nuclear weapons
											in our world.

											This was sent to me by somebody
