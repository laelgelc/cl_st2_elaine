											I want to talk to you a little bit about
											why the visions of Jeremy Rivkins,
											who would like to ban these sorts of technologies,
											or of the Bill Joys who would like to relinquish them,
											are actually — to follow those paths would be such a tragedy for us.
											I&#39;m focusing on biology,
											the biological sciences.
											The reason I&#39;m doing that is because those are going to be
											the areas that are the most significant to us.
											The reason for that is really very simple.
											It&#39;s because we&#39;re flesh and blood.
											We&#39;re biological creatures.
											And what we can do with our biology
											is going to shape our future
											and that of our children and that of their children —
											whether we gain control over aging,
											whether we learn to protect ourselves from Alzheimer&#39;s,
											and heart disease, and cancer.

											Life is short, you know.
											And we need to think about planning a little bit.
											We&#39;re all going to eventually, even in the developed world,

											This is where it&#39;s really central to our lives.
											Now I know there&#39;s been a whole lot of hype
											about our power to control biology.
											You just have to look at the Human Genome Project.
											It wasn&#39;t two years ago
											that everybody was talking about —
											we&#39;ve found the Holy Grail of biology.
											We&#39;re deciphering the code of codes.
											We&#39;re reading the book of life.
											It&#39;s a little bit reminiscent of 1969 when Neil Armstrong walked on the moon,
											and everybody was about to race out toward the stars.
											And we&#39;ve all seen &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey.&quot;
											You know it&#39;s 2003, and there is no HAL.
											And there is no odyssey to our own moon, much less the moons of Jupiter.
											And we&#39;re still picking up pieces of the Challenger.
											So it&#39;s not surprising that some people would wonder
											whether maybe 30 or 40 years from now,
											we&#39;ll look back at this instant in time,
											and all of the sort of talk about
											the Human Genome Project,
											and what all this is going to mean to us —
											well, it will really mean precious little.
											And I just want to say that that is absolutely not going to be the case.
											Because when we talk about our genetics and our biology,
											and modifying and altering and adjusting these things,
											we&#39;re talking about changing ourselves.
											And this is very critical stuff.

											If you have any doubts about how technology affects our lives,

											This is not the stomping ground

											What&#39;s happening is we&#39;re taking this technology —
											it&#39;s becoming more precise, more potent —
											and we&#39;re turning it back upon ourselves.
											Before it&#39;s all done
											we are going to alter ourselves
											every bit as much as we have changed the world around us.
											It&#39;s going to happen a lot sooner

											It&#39;s going to change the way we have children.

											The larger context of this is that are

											The first of them is the obvious one,
											the silicon revolution,
											which you all are very, very familiar with.
											It&#39;s changing our lives in so many ways,
											and it will continue to do that.
											What the essence of that is, is that we&#39;re taking
											the sand at our feet, the inert silicon at our feet,
											and we&#39;re breathing a level of complexity into it
											that rivals that of life itself,
											and may even surpass it.

											The genomics revolution,

											that sound so terrific on grants and on business plans.
											What we&#39;re doing is we are
											seizing control of our evolutionary future.
											I mean we&#39;re essentially using technology
											to just jam evolution into fast-forward.
											It&#39;s not at all clear where it&#39;s going to take us.
											But in five to ten years we&#39;re going to start see
											some very profound changes.
											The most immediate changes that we&#39;ll see
											are things like in medicine.
											There is going to be a big shift towards preventative medicine
											as we start to be able to identify
											all of the risk factors that we have as individuals.
											But who is going to pay for all this?

											There&#39;s pharmacogenomics, the combination of pharmacology
											and genetics:
											tailoring drugs to our individual constitutions
											that Juan talked about a little bit earlier.
											That&#39;s going to have amazing impacts.
											And it&#39;s going to be used for diet as well,

											Another thing is that we&#39;re just going to have to deal with this knowledge.
											It&#39;s really wonderful when we hear,
											&quot;Oh, 99.9 percent of the letters in the code are the same.
											We&#39;re all identical to each other. Isn&#39;t it wonderful?&quot;
											And look around you and know
											that what we really care about is

											We look the same to a visitor from another planet, maybe,
											but not to each other

											And we&#39;re going to have to come to grips with the fact

											That&#39;s the focus of my book &quot;Redesigning Humans,&quot;

											There are three obvious ways of doing this.
											The first is cloning.
											It didn&#39;t happen.
											It&#39;s a total media circus.
											It will happen in five to 10 years.

											But there are more important things that are already occurring:
											embryo screening.
											You take a six to eight cell embryo,
											you tease out one of the cells, you run a genetic test on that cell,
											and depending on the results of that test
											you either implant that embryo or you discard it.
											It&#39;s already done to avoid rare diseases today.
											And pretty soon it&#39;s going to be possible
											to avoid virtually all genetic diseases in that way.
											As that becomes possible
											this is going to move from something that is used by those who
											have infertility problems and are already doing in vitro fertilization,
											to the wealthy who want to protect their children,
											to just about everybody else.
											And in that process that&#39;s going to morph
											from being just for diseases,
											to being for lesser vulnerabilities,
											like risk of manic depression or something,
											to picking personalities,
											temperaments, traits, these sorts of things.
											Of course there is going to be genetic engineering.
											Directly going in — it&#39;s a little bit further away, but not that far away —
											going in and altering the genes in the first cell in an embryo.
											The way I suspect it will happen
											is using artificial chromosomes
											and extra chromosomes, so we go from 46
											to 47 or 48.
											And one that is not heritable
											because who would want to pass on to their children
											the archaic enhancement modules
											that they got 25 years earlier from their parents?
											It&#39;s a joke; of course they wouldn&#39;t want to do that.

											Those kinds of loose analogies with

											It is being funded very very —

											The second is, we&#39;re human.
											That&#39;s what we do.
											We try and use our technology to

											is as much a denial of who we are
											as to imagine
											that we&#39;ll use these technologies and not fret
											and worry about it a great deal.

											People can try and ban these things.

											But ultimately all this is going to do
											is just shift development elsewhere.
											It&#39;s going to drive these things from view.
											It&#39;s going to reserve the technology for the wealthy
											because they are in the best position
											to circumvent any of these sorts of laws.
											And it&#39;s going to deny us
											the information that we need to make wise decisions

											and think that we&#39;re going to reach a consensus about these things.
											That is simply not going to happen.
											They touch us too deeply.
											And they depend too much upon history, upon philosophy,
											upon religion, upon culture, upon politics.
											Some people are going to see this
											as an abomination,
											as the worst thing, as just awful.

											The one thing though that is really dangerous

											with the basic rhythms of our biology and our health.

											In the midst of all this amazing technology,
											and all these things that are occurring, it&#39;s really interesting
											because there is sort of a counter-revolution that is going on:
											a resurgence of interest in remedies from the past,
											in nutraceuticals, in all of these sorts of things
											that some people, in the pharmaceutical industry particularly,
											like to brand as non-science.
											But this whole effort is generated,
											is driven, by IT as well
											because that is how we&#39;re gathering all this information,
											and linking it, and integrating it together.
											There is a lot in this rich biota that is going to serve us well.
											And that&#39;s where about half of our drugs come.
											So we shouldn&#39;t dismiss this
											because it&#39;s an enormous opportunity to use
											these sorts of results,
											or these random loose trials from the last thousand years
											about what has impacts on our health.
											And to use our advanced technologies

											In fact this isn&#39;t just abstract.
											I just formed a biotechnology company
											that is using
											this sort of an approach to develop
											therapeutics for Alzheimer&#39;s and other diseases of aging,
											and we&#39;re making some real progress.
											So here we are.
											It&#39;s the beginning of a new millennium.
											If you look forward,

											far before the end of this millennium,

											And from the beginning of today&#39;s sessions

											difficult, painful period
											that we struggled through.
											And I don&#39;t think that&#39;s what&#39;s going to happen.
											They&#39;re going to do like everybody does. They are going to forget about all that stuff.
											And they are actually going to romanticize this moment in time.

											as this glorious instant

											the very foundations of their lives,
											of their society, of their future.
											You know it&#39;s a little bit like a birth.

											So to me,
											it&#39;s clear that one of the foundations of that future
											is going to be the reworking of our biology.
											It&#39;s going to come gradually at first. It&#39;s going to pick up speed.
											We&#39;re going to make lots of errors.
											That&#39;s the way these things work.
											To me it&#39;s an incredible privilege
											to be alive now
											and to be able to witness this thing.
											It is something that is a unique instant
											in the history of all of life.
											It will always be remembered.
											And what&#39;s extraordinary is that
											we&#39;re not just observing this,
											we are the architects of this.
											I think that we should be proud of it.
											What is so difficult and challenging
											is that we are also the objects of these changes.
											It&#39;s our health, it&#39;s our lives, it&#39;s our future, it&#39;s our children.
											And that is why they are so very troubling to so many people
											who would pull back in fear.
											I think that our choice
											in the choice of life,
											is not whether we&#39;re going to go down this path.
											We are, definitely.
											It&#39;s how we hold it in our hearts.
											It&#39;s how we look at it.
											I think Thucydides really spoke to us very clearly
											in 430 B.C. He put it nicely.
											Again, I&#39;ll use the words in the same order he did.
											&quot;The bravest are surely those
											who have the clearest vision of what is before them,
											both glory and danger alike.
											And yet notwithstanding, they go out and they meet it.&quot;
