											When I was asked to do this,
											I was also asked to look at all 14 TED Talks
											that I had given,
											chronologically.
											The first one was actually two hours.
											The second one was an hour,
											and then they became half hours,
											and all I noticed was my bald spot getting bigger.
											(Laughter)
											Imagine seeing your life, 30 years of it, go by,
											and it was, to say the least,
											for me, quite a shocking experience.
											So what I&#39;m going to do in my time
											is try and share with you what happened
											during the 30 years,
											and then also make a prediction,
											and then tell you a little bit
											about what I&#39;m doing next.
											And I put on a slide
											where TED 1 happened in my life.
											And it&#39;s rather important
											because I had done 15 years of research before it,
											so I had a backlog, so it was easy.
											It&#39;s not that I was Fidel Castro
											and I could talk for two hours,
											or Bucky Fuller.
											I had 15 years of stuff,
											and the Media Lab was about to start.
											So that was easy.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											But there are a couple of things
											about that period
											and about what happened that are
											really quite important.
											One is that
											it was a period when computers
											weren&#39;t yet for people.
											And the other thing that sort of happened
											during that time is that
											we were considered sissy computer scientists.
											We weren&#39;t considered the real thing.
											So what I&#39;m going to show you is, in retrospect,
											a lot more interesting and a lot more accepted
											than it was at the time.

											So I&#39;m going to characterize the years
											and I&#39;m even going to go back
											to some very early work of mine,
											and this was the kind of stuff I was doing in the &#39;60s:
											very direct manipulation,
											very influenced as I studied architecture
											by the architect Moshe Safdie,
											and you can see that we even built robotic things
											that could build habitat-like structures.
											And this for me was
											not yet the Media Lab,
											but was the beginning of what I&#39;ll call
											sensory computing,
											and I pick fingers
											partly because everybody thought it was ridiculous.
											Papers were published
											about how stupid it was to use fingers.
											Three reasons: One was they were low-resolution.
											The other is your hand would occlude
											what you wanted to see,
											and the third, which was the winner,
											was that your fingers would get the screen dirty,
											and hence, fingers would never be
											a device that you&#39;d use.
											And this was a device we built in the &#39;70s,
											which has never even been picked up.
											It&#39;s not just touch sensitive,
											it&#39;s pressure sensitive.

											Entebbe happened.
											1976, Air France was hijacked,
											taken to Entebbe,
											and the Israelis not only did an extraordinary rescue,
											they did it partly because they had practiced
											on a physical model of the airport,
											because they had built the airport,
											so they built a model in the desert,
											and when they arrived at Entebbe,
											they knew where to go because
they had actually been there.
											The U.S. government asked some of us, &#39;76,
											if we could replicate that computationally,
											and of course somebody like myself says yes.
											Immediately, you get a contract,
											Department of Defense,
											and we built this truck and this rig.
											We did sort of a simulation,
											because you had video discs,
											and again, this is &#39;76.
											And then many years later,
											you get this truck,
											and so you have Google Maps.

											Still people thought,
											no, that was not serious computer science,
											and it was a man named Jerry Wiesner,
											who happened to be the president of MIT,
											who did think it was computer science.
											And one of the keys for anybody
											who wants to start something in life:
											Make sure your president is part of it.
											So when I was doing the Media Lab,
											it was like having a gorilla in the front seat.
											If you were stopped for speeding
											and the officer looked in the window
											and saw who was in the passenger seat,
											then, &quot;Oh, continue on, sir.&quot;
											And so we were able,
											and this is a cute, actually, device, parenthetically.
											This was a lenticular photograph of Jerry Wiesner
											where the only thing that changed in the photograph
											were the lips.
											So when you oscillated that little piece
											of lenticular sheet with his photograph,
											it would be in lip sync
											with zero bandwidth.
											It was a zero-bandwidth teleconferencing system
											at the time.

											So this was the Media Lab&#39;s —
											this is what we said we&#39;d do,
											that the world of computers, publishing,
											and so on would come together.
											Again, not generally accepted,
											but very much part of TED in the early days.
											And this is really where we were headed.
											And that created the Media Lab.
											One of the things about age
											is that I can tell you with great confidence,
											I&#39;ve been to the future.
											I&#39;ve been there, actually, many times.
											And the reason I say that is,
											how many times in my life have I said,
											&quot;Oh, in 10 years, this will happen,&quot;
											and then 10 years comes.
											And then you say, &quot;Oh, in
five years, this will happen.&quot;
											And then five years comes.
											So I say this a little bit with having felt
											that I&#39;d been there a number of times,
											and one of the things that is most quoted
											that I&#39;ve ever said
											is that computing is not about computers,
											and that didn&#39;t quite get enough traction,
											and then it started to.
											It started to because people caught on
											that the medium wasn&#39;t the message.
											And the reason I show this car
											in actually a rather ugly slide
											is just again to tell you the kind of story
											that characterized a little bit of my life.
											This is a student of mine
											who had done a Ph.D. called &quot;Backseat Driver.&quot;
											It was in the early days of GPS,
											the car knew where it was,
											and it would give audio instructions
											to the driver, when to turn right, 
when to turn left and so on.
											Turns out, there are a lot of things
											in those instructions that back in that period
											were pretty challenging,
											like what does it mean, take the next right?
											Well, if you&#39;re coming up on a street,
											the next right&#39;s probably the one after,
											and there are lots of issues,
											and the student did a wonderful thesis,
											and the MIT patent office said &quot;Don&#39;t patent it.
											It&#39;ll never be accepted.
											The liabilities are too large.
											There will be insurance issues.
											Don&#39;t patent it.&quot;
											So we didn&#39;t,
											but it shows you how people, again, at times,
											don&#39;t really look at what&#39;s happening.

											Some work, and I&#39;ll just go

											And then there are at least three heroes
											I want to quickly mention.
											Marvin Minsky, who taught me a lot
											about common sense,
											and I will talk briefly about Muriel Cooper,
											who was very important to Ricky Wurman
											and to TED, and in fact, when she got onstage,
											she said, the first thing she said was,
											&quot;I introduced Ricky to Nicky.&quot;
											And nobody calls me Nicky
											and nobody calls Richard Ricky,
											so nobody knew who she was talking about.
											And then, of course, Seymour Papert,
											who is the person who said,
											&quot;You can&#39;t think about thinking
											unless you think about thinking about something.&quot;
											And that&#39;s actually — you can unpack that later.
											It&#39;s a pretty profound statement.

									<p>
											I&#39;m showing some slides
											that were from TED 2,
											a little silly as slides, perhaps.
											Then I felt television really was about displays.
											Again, now we&#39;re past TED 1,
											but just around the time of TED 2,
											and what I&#39;d like to mention here is,
											even though you could imagine
											intelligence in the device,
											I look today at some of the work
											being done about the Internet of Things,
											and I think it&#39;s kind of tragically pathetic,
											because what has happened is people take
											the oven panel and put it on your cell phone,
											or the door key onto your cell phone,
											just taking it and bringing it to you,
											and in fact that&#39;s actually what you don&#39;t want.
											You want to put a chicken in the oven,
											and the oven says, &quot;Aha, it&#39;s a chicken,&quot;
											and it cooks the chicken.
											&quot;Oh, it&#39;s cooking the chicken for Nicholas,
											and he likes it this way and that way.&quot;
											So the intelligence, instead of being in the device,
											we have started today
											to move it back onto the cell phone
											or closer to the user,
											not a particularly enlightened view
											of the Internet of Things.
											Television, again, television what I said today,
											that was back in 1990,
											and the television of tomorrow
											would look something like that.
											Again, people, but they laughed cynically,
											they didn&#39;t laugh with much appreciation.

											And then something for me changed
											pretty profoundly.
											I became more involved with computers and learning
											and influenced by Seymour,
											but particularly looking at learning
											as something that is best approximated
											by computer programming.
											When you write a computer program,
											you&#39;ve got to not just list things out
											and sort of take an algorithm
											and translate it into a set of instructions,
											but when there&#39;s a bug, and all programs have bugs,
											you&#39;ve got to de-bug it.
											You&#39;ve got to go in, change it,
											and then re-execute,
											and you iterate,
											and that iteration is really
											a very, very good approximation of learning.

											So that led to my own work with Seymour
											in places like Cambodia
											and the starting of One Laptop per Child.
											Enough TED Talks on One Laptop per Child,
											so I&#39;ll go through it very fast,
											but it did give us the chance
											to do something at a relatively large scale
											in the area of learning, development and computing.
											Very few people know that One Laptop per Child
											was a $1 billion project,
											and it was, at least over the seven years I ran it,
											but even more important, the World Bank
											contributed zero, USAID zero.
											It was mostly the countries
using their own treasuries,
											which is very interesting,
											at least to me it was very interesting
											in terms of what I plan to do next.

											I then tried an experiment,
											and the experiment happened in Ethiopia.
											And here&#39;s the experiment.
											The experiment is,
											can learning happen where there are no schools.
											And we dropped off tablets
											with no instructions
											and let the children figure it out.
											And in a short period of time,
											they not only
											turned them on and were using 50 apps per child
											within five days,
											they were singing &quot;ABC&quot; songs within two weeks,
											but they hacked Android within six months.
											And so that seemed sufficiently interesting.
											This is perhaps the best picture I have.
											The kid on your right
											has sort of nominated himself as teacher.
											Look at the kid on the left, and so on.
											There are no adults involved in this at all.
											So I said, well can we do this
											at a larger scale?
											And what is it that&#39;s missing?
											The kids are giving a press conference at this point,
											and sort of writing in the dirt.
											And the answer is, what is missing?
											And I&#39;m going to skip over my prediction, actually,

											Poverty tends to be created by our society,
											and the people in that community are not poor
											in the same way at all.
											They may be primitive,
											but the way to approach it and to connect them,
											the history of One Laptop per Child,
											and the experiment in Ethiopia,
											lead me to believe that we can in fact
											do this in a very short period of time.

											And so my plan,
											and unfortunately I haven&#39;t been able
											to get my partners at this point
											to let me announce them,
											but is to do this with a stationary satellite.
											There are many reasons
											that stationary satellites aren&#39;t the best things,
											but there are a lot of reasons why they are,
											and for two billion dollars,
											you can connect a lot more than 100 million people,
											but the reason I picked two,
											and I will leave this as my last slide,
											is two billion dollars
											is what we were spending
											in Afghanistan
											every week.
											So surely if we can connect
											Africa and the last billion people
											for numbers like that,
											we should be doing it.

											NN: Thank you for asking.
											I&#39;ll tell you what my prediction is,
											and my prediction, and this is a prediction,
											because it&#39;ll be 30 years. I won&#39;t be here.
											But one of the things about learning how to read,
											we have been doing a lot of consuming
											of information going through our eyes,
											and so that may be a very inefficient channel.
											So my prediction is that we are 
going to ingest information
											You&#39;re going to swallow a pill and know English.
											You&#39;re going to swallow a
pill and know Shakespeare.
											And the way to do it is through the bloodstream.
											So once it&#39;s in your bloodstream,
											it basically goes through it and gets into the brain,
											and when it knows that it&#39;s in the brain
											in the different pieces,
											it deposits it in the right places.
											So it&#39;s ingesting.
