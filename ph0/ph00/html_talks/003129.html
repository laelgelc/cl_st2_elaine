											So if someone asked you
											for the three words that would sum up
											your reputation, what would you say?
											How would people describe your judgment,
											your knowledge, your behaviors, in different situations?
											Today I&#39;d like to explore with you
											why the answer to this question
											will become profoundly important
											in an age where reputation will be your most valuable asset.

											I&#39;d like to start by introducing you to someone
											whose life has been changed by a marketplace
											fueled by reputation.
											Sebastian Sandys has been a bed and breakfast host
											on Airbnb since 2008.
											I caught up with him recently, where, over the course
											of several cups of tea, he told me how
											hosting guests from all over the world
											has enriched his life.
											More than 50 people have come to stay in the 18th-century
											watchhouse he lives in with his cat, Squeak.
											Now, I mention Squeak because Sebastian&#39;s first guest
											happened to see a rather large mouse run across the kitchen,
											and she promised that she would refrain from leaving
											a bad review on one condition: he got a cat.
											And so Sebastian bought Squeak to protect his reputation.

									<p>
											Now, as many of you know, Airbnb is a peer-to-peer
											marketplace that matches people who have space to rent
											with people who are looking for a place to stay
											in over 192 countries.
											The places being rented out are things that you might
											expect, like spare rooms and holiday homes,
											but part of the magic is the unique places
											that you can now access: treehouses, teepees,
											airplane hangars, igloos.
											If you don&#39;t like the hotel, there&#39;s a castle down the road
											that you can rent for 5,000 dollars a night.
											It&#39;s a fantastic example of how technology
											is creating a market
											for things that never had a marketplace before.

											Now let me show you these heat maps of Paris
											to see how insanely fast it&#39;s growing.
											This image here is from 2008.
											The pink dots represent host properties.
											Even four years ago, letting strangers stay in your home
											seemed like a crazy idea.
											Now the same view in 2010.
											And now, 2012.
											There is an Airbnb host on almost every main street in Paris.
											Now, what&#39;s happening here is people are realizing
											the power of technology to unlock the idling capacity
											and value of all kinds of assets,
											from skills to spaces to material possessions,
											in ways and on a scale never possible before.
											It&#39;s an economy and culture called collaborative consumption,
											and, through it, people like Sebastian
											are becoming micro-entrepreneurs.
											They&#39;re empowered to make money and save money
											from their existing assets.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											But the real magic and the secret source behind
											collaborative consumption marketplaces like Airbnb
											isn&#39;t the inventory or the money.
											It&#39;s using the power of technology to build trust
											between strangers.
											This side of Airbnb really hit home to Sebastian last summer
											during the London riots.
											He woke up around 9, and he checked his email
											and he saw a bunch of messages all asking him
											if he was okay.
											Former guests from around the world had seen that
											the riots were happening just down the street, and wanted
											to check if he needed anything.
											Sebastian actually said to me, he said, &quot;Thirteen former guests
											contacted me before my own mother rang.&quot; (Laughter)

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now, this little anecdote gets to the heart of why
											I&#39;m really passionate about collaborative consumption,
											and why, after I finished my book, I decided
											I&#39;m going to try and spread this into a global movement.
											Because at its core, it&#39;s about empowerment.
											It&#39;s about empowering people to make meaningful connections,
											connections that are enabling us to rediscover
											a humanness that we&#39;ve lost somewhere along the way,
											by engaging in marketplaces like Airbnb, like Kickstarter,
											like Etsy, that are built on personal relationships
											versus empty transactions.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now the irony is that these ideas are actually taking us back
											to old market principles and collaborative behaviors
											that are hard-wired in all of us.
											They&#39;re just being reinvented in ways that are relevant
											for the Facebook age.
											We&#39;re literally beginning to realize that we have wired
											our world to share, swap, rent, barter or trade
											just about anything. We&#39;re sharing our cars on WhipCar,
											our bikes on Spinlister, our offices on Loosecubes,
											our gardens on Landshare. We&#39;re lending and borrowing
											money from strangers on Zopa and Lending Club.
											We are trading lessons on everything from sushi-making
											to coding on Skillshare,
											and we&#39;re even sharing our pets on DogVacay.
											Now welcome to the wonderful world of collaborative consumption
											that&#39;s enabling us to match wants with haves
											in more democratic ways.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now, collaborative consumption is creating the start
											of a transformation in the way we think about supply and demand,
											but it&#39;s also a part of a massive value shift underway,
											where instead of consuming to keep up with the Joneses,
											people are consuming to get to know the Joneses.
											But the key reason why it&#39;s taking off now so fast
											is because every new advancement of technology
											increases the efficiency and the social glue of trust
											to make sharing easier and easier.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now, I&#39;ve looked at thousands of these marketplaces,
											and trust and efficiency are always the critical ingredients.
											Let me give you an example.
											Meet 46-year-old Chris Mok, who has, I bet,
											the best job title here of SuperRabbit.
											Now, four years ago, Chris lost his job, unfortunately,
											as an art buyer at Macy&#39;s, and like so many people,
											he struggled to find a new one during the recession.
											And then he happened to stumble across a post about
											TaskRabbit.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now, the story behind TaskRabbit starts like so many
											great stories with a very cute dog by the name of Kobe.
											Now what happened was, in February 2008,
											Leah and her husband were waiting for a cab to take them
											out for dinner, when Kobe came trotting up to them
											and he was salivating with saliva.
											They realized they&#39;d run out of dog food.
											Kevin had to cancel the cab and trudge out in the snow.
											Now, later that evening, the two self-confessed tech geeks
											starting talking about how cool it would be if some kind of
											eBay for errands existed.
											Six months later, Leah quit her job,
											and TaskRabbit was born.
											At the time, she didn&#39;t realize that she was actually hitting
											on a bigger idea she later called service networking.
											It&#39;s essentially about how we use our online relationships
											to get things done in the real world.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now the way TaskRabbit works is, people outsource
											the tasks that they want doing, name the price
											they&#39;re willing to pay, and then vetted Rabbits
											bid to run the errand.
											Yes, there&#39;s actually a four-stage, rigorous interview process
											that&#39;s designed to find the people that would make
											great personal assistants and weed out the dodgy Rabbits.
											Now, there&#39;s over 4,000 Rabbits across the United States
											and 5,000 more on the waiting list.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now the tasks being posted are things that you might
											expect, like help with household chores
											or doing some supermarket runs.
											I actually learned the other day that 12 and a half thousand
											loads of laundry have been cleaned and folded
											through TaskRabbit.
											But I love that the number one task posted,
											over a hundred times a day, is something that many of us
											have felt the pain of doing:
											yes, assembling Ikea furniture. (Laughter) (Applause)
											It&#39;s brilliant. Now, we may laugh, but Chris here
											is actually making up to 5,000 dollars a month
											running errands around his life.
											And 70 percent of this new labor force
											were previously unemployed or underemployed.
											I think TaskRabbit and other examples of collaborative consumption
											are like lemonade stands on steroids. They&#39;re just brilliant.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now, when you think about it, it&#39;s amazing, right,
											that over the past 20 years, we&#39;ve evolved
											from trusting people online to share information
											to trusting to handing over our credit card information,
											and now we&#39;re entering the third trust wave:
											connecting trustworthy strangers to create all kinds
											of people-powered marketplaces.
											I actually came across this fascinating study
											by the Pew Center this week that revealed
											that an active Facebook user is three times as likely
											as a non-Internet user to believe that most people are trustworthy.
											Virtual trust will transform the way we trust one another
											face to face.

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now, with all of my optimism, and I am an optimist,
											comes a healthy dose of caution, or rather, an urgent need
											to address some pressing, complex questions.
											How to ensure our digital identities reflect our
											real world identities? Do we want them to be the same?
											How do we mimic the way trust is built face-to-face online?
											How do we stop people who&#39;ve behaved badly
											in one community doing so under a different guise?
											In a similar way that companies often use some kind of
											credit rating to decide whether to give you a mobile plan,
											or the rate of a mortgage, marketplaces that depend
											on transactions between relative strangers
											need some kind of device to let you know that Sebastian
											and Chris are good eggs,
											and that device is reputation.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Reputation is the measurement of how much a community trusts you.
											Let&#39;s just take a look at Chris.
											You can see that over 200 people have given him
											an average rating over 4.99 out of 5.
											There are over 20 pages of reviews of his work
											describing him as super-friendly and fast,
											and he&#39;s reached level 25, the highest level,
											making him a SuperRabbit.
											Now — (Laughter) — I love that word, SuperRabbit.
											And interestingly, what Chris has noted is that as his reputation
											has gone up, so has his chances of winning a bid
											and how much he can charge.
											In other words, for SuperRabbits, reputation
											has a real world value.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now, I know what you might be thinking.
											Well, this isn&#39;t anything new. Just think of power sellers
											on eBay or star ratings on Amazon.
											The difference today is that, with every trade we make,
											comment we leave, person we flag, badge we earn,
											we leave a reputation trail
											of how well we can and can&#39;t be trusted.
											And it&#39;s not just the breadth but the volume
											of reputation data out there that is staggering.
											Just consider this: Five million nights have been booked
											on Airbnb in the past six months alone.
											30 million rides have been shared on Carpooling.com.
											This year, two billion dollars worth of loans
											will go through peer-to-peer lending platforms.
											This adds up to millions of pieces of reputation data
											on how well we behave or misbehave.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now, capturing and correlating the trails of information
											that we leave in different places is a massive challenge,
											but one we&#39;re being asked to figure out.
											What the likes of Sebastian are starting to rightfully ask
											is, shouldn&#39;t they own their reputation data?
											Shouldn&#39;t the reputation that he&#39;s personally invested
											on building on Airbnb mean that it should travel with him
											from one community to another?
											What I mean by this is, say he started selling second-hand
											books on Amazon. Why should he have to start from scratch?
											It&#39;s a bit like when I moved from New York to Sydney.
											It was ridiculous. I couldn&#39;t get a mobile phone plan
											because my credit history didn&#39;t travel with me.
											I was essentially a ghost in the system.

							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now I&#39;m not suggesting that the next stage
											of the reputation economy is about
											adding up multiple ratings into some kind of empty score.
											People&#39;s lives are too complex, and who wants to do that?
											I also want to be clear that this isn&#39;t about adding up
											tweets and likes and friends in a Klout-like fashion.
											Those guys are measuring influence, not behaviors
											that indicate our trustworthiness.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											But the most important thing that we have to keep in mind
											is that reputation is largely contextual.
											Just because Sebastian is a wonderful host
											does not mean that he can assemble Ikea furniture.
											The big challenge is figuring out what data
											makes sense to pull, because the future&#39;s
											going to be driven by a smart aggregation of reputation,
											not a single algorithm.
											It&#39;s only a matter of time before we&#39;ll be able to perform
											a Facebook- or Google-like search
											and see a complete picture of someone&#39;s behaviors
											in different contexts over time.
											I envision a realtime stream of who has trusted you,
											when, where and why, your reliability on TaskRabbit,
											your cleanliness as a guest on Airbnb,
											the knowledge that you display on Quora or Tripovo,
											they&#39;ll all live together in one place,
											and this will live in some kind of reputation dashboard
											that will paint a picture of your reputation capital.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now this is a concept that I&#39;m currently researching
											and writing my next book on, and currently define
											as the worth of your reputation, your intentions,
											capabilities and values across communities and marketplaces.
											This isn&#39;t some far-off frontier.
											There are actually a wave of startups like Connect.Me
											and Legit and TrustCloud that are figuring out how
											you can aggregate, monitor and use your online reputation.

									<p>
											Now, I realize that this concept may sound a little
											Big Brother to some of you, and yes, there are some
											enormous transparency and privacy issues to solve,
											but ultimately, if we can collect our personal reputation,
											we can actually control it more, and extract
											the immense value that will flow from it.

											Also, more so than our credit history,
											we can actually shape our reputation.
											Just think of Sebastian
											and how he bought the cat to influence his.

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now privacy issues aside, the other really interesting issue
											I&#39;m looking at is how do we empower digital ghosts,
											people [who] for whatever reason, are not active online,
											but are some of the most trustworthy people in the world?
											How do we take their contributions to their jobs,
											their communities and their families,
											and convert that value into reputation capital?

							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Ultimately, when we get it right, reputation capital
											could create a massive positive disruption
											in who has power, trust and influence.
											A three-digit score, your traditional credit history,
											that only 30 percent of us actually know what it is,
											will no longer be the determining factor
											in how much things cost, what we can access,
											and, in many instances, limit what we can do in the world.
											Indeed, reputation is a currency that I believe will become
											more powerful than our credit history in the 21st century.
											Reputation will be the currency that says
											that you can trust me.

											Now the interesting thing is, reputation
											is the socioeconomic lubricant
											that makes collaborative consumption work and scale,
											but the sources it will be generated from,
											and its applications, are far bigger than this space alone.

											Four years ago, tech bloggers and entrepreneurs
											Joel Spolsky and Jeff Atwood, decided to start something
											called Stack Overflow.
											Now, Stack Overflow is basically a platform where
											experienced programmers can ask
											other good programmers highly detailed technical questions
											on things like tiny pixels and chrome extensions.
											This site receives five and a half thousand questions a day,
											and 80 percent of these receive accurate answers.
											Now users earn reputation in a whole range of ways,

											they know what they&#39;re talking about.

											Now a few months after this site launched, the founders
											heard about something interesting,

											What they heard was that users were putting
											their reputation scores on the top of their résumés,
											and that recruiters were searching the platform
											to find people with unique talents.

											But the bigger principle of what&#39;s happening behind Stack Overflow,

											People are starting to realize that the reputation

											You know, it&#39;s very interesting.
											When you talk to super-users, whether that&#39;s SuperRabbits

											they all talk about how having a high reputation
											unlocks a sense of their own power.
											On Stack Overflow, it creates a level playing field,

											on a bad, rainy day, when he hasn&#39;t had a customer
											in his bookstore, he thinks of all the people around
											the world who&#39;ve said something wonderful about him,
											and what that says about him as a person.
											He&#39;s turning 50 this year, and he&#39;s convinced
											that the rich tapestry of reputation he&#39;s built on Airbnb
											will lead him to doing something interesting
											with the rest of his life.

											You know, there are only a few windows in history
											where the opportunity exists to reinvent
											part of how our socioeconomic system works.
											We&#39;re living through one of those moments.
											I believe that we are at the start of a collaborative revolution
											that will be as significant as the Industrial Revolution.
											In the 20th century, the invention of traditional credit
											transformed our consumer system, and in many ways
											controlled who had access to what.
											In the 21st century, new trust networks,
											and the reputation capital they generate, will reinvent
											the way we think about wealth, markets, power
											and personal identity, in ways we can&#39;t yet even imagine.
											Thank you very much. (Applause)
