											So, there&#39;s about
seven and a half billion of us.
											The World Health Organization tells us
that 300 million of us are depressed,
											and about 800,000 people
take their lives every year.
											A tiny subset of them choose
a profoundly nihilistic route,
											which is they die in the act of killing
as many people as possible.
											These are some famous recent examples.
											And here&#39;s a less famous one.
It happened about nine weeks ago.
											If you don&#39;t remember it,
											it&#39;s because there&#39;s
a lot of this going on.
											Wikipedia just last year
counted 323 mass shootings
											in my home country, the United States.
											Not all of those shooters were suicidal,
											not all of them were maximizing
their death tolls,
											but many, many were.

											An important question becomes:
What limits do these people have?
											Take the Vegas shooter.
											He slaughtered 58 people.
											Did he stop there because he&#39;d had enough?
											No, and we know this because
he shot and injured another 422 people
											who he surely would have
preferred to kill.
											We have no reason to think
he would have stopped at 4,200.
											In fact, with somebody this nihilistic,
he may well have gladly killed us all.
											We don&#39;t know.
											What we do know is this:
											when suicidal murderers really go all in,

											Here&#39;s an example.
											Several years back, there was a rash
of 10 mass school attacks in China
											carried out with things
like knives and hammers and cleavers,
											because guns are really hard to get there.
											By macabre coincidence,
this last attack occurred
											just hours before the massacre
in Newtown, Connecticut.
											But that one American attack killed
roughly the same number of victims
											as the 10 Chinese attacks combined.
											So we can fairly say,
knife: terrible; gun: way worse.
											And airplane: massively worse,
											as pilot Andreas Lubitz showed
when he forced 149 people
											to join him in his suicide,
											smashing a plane into the French Alps.

											And there are other examples of this.
											And I&#39;m afraid there are far more deadly
weapons in our near future than airplanes,
											ones not made of metal.
											So let&#39;s consider the apocalyptic
dynamics that will ensue
											if suicidal mass murder hitches a ride
on a rapidly advancing field
											that for the most part holds
boundless promise for society.
											Somewhere out there in the world,
there&#39;s a tiny group of people
											who would attempt, however ineptly,
											to kill us all if they
could just figure out how.
											The Vegas shooter may or may not
have been one of them,
											but with seven and a half billion of us,
											this is a nonzero population.
											There&#39;s plenty of suicidal
nihilists out there.
											We&#39;ve already seen that.
											There&#39;s people with severe mood disorders
that they can&#39;t even control.
											There are people who have just suffered
deranging traumas, etc. etc.
											As for the corollary group,
											its size was simply zero forever
until the Cold War,

of two global alliances

											So is synthetic biology,

did something every bit as ingenious

											Now, the good news about the 2011 biohack
											is that the people who did it
didn&#39;t mean us any harm.
											They&#39;re virologists.
											They believed they were advancing science.
											The bad news is that technology
does not freeze in place,
											and over the next few decades,
											their feat will become trivially easy.
											In fact, it&#39;s already way easier,
because as we learned yesterday morning,
											just two years after they did their work,
											the CRISPR system was harnessed
for genome editing.
											This was a radical breakthrough
											that makes gene editing
massively easier —
											so easy that CRISPR
is now taught in high schools.
											And this stuff is moving
quicker than computing.
											That slow, stodgy white line up there?
											That&#39;s Moore&#39;s law.
											That shows us how quickly
computing is getting cheaper.
											That steep, crazy-fun green line,
											that shows us how quickly
genetic sequencing is getting cheaper.
											Now, gene editing
and synthesis and sequencing,
											they&#39;re different disciplines,
but they&#39;re tightly related.
											And they&#39;re all moving
in these headlong rates.
											And the keys to the kingdom
are these tiny, tiny data files.
											That is an excerpt of H5N1&#39;s genome.
											The whole thing can fit
on just a few pages.
											And yeah, don&#39;t worry, you can Google this
as soon as you get home.
											It&#39;s all over the internet, right?
											And the part that made it contagious
											could well fit on a single Post-it note.
											And once a genius makes a data file,
											any idiot can copy it,
											distribute it worldwide
											or print it.
											And I don&#39;t just mean print it on this,
											but soon enough, on this.

											So let&#39;s imagine a scenario.
											Let&#39;s say it&#39;s 2026,
to pick an arbitrary year,
											and a brilliant virologist,
hoping to advance science
											and better understand pandemics,
											designs a new bug.
											It&#39;s as contagious as chicken pox,
											it&#39;s as deadly as Ebola,
											and it incubates for months and months
before causing an outbreak,
											so the whole world can be infected
before the first sign of trouble.
											Then, her university gets hacked.
											And of course,
this is not science fiction.
											In fact, just one recent US indictment
											documents the hacking
of over 300 universities.
											So that file with the bug&#39;s genome on it
spreads to the internet&#39;s dark corners.
											And once a file is out there,
it never comes back —
											just ask anybody who runs
a movie studio or a music label.
											So now maybe in 2026,
											it would take a true genius
like our virologist
											to make the actual living critter,
											but 15 years later,
											it may just take a DNA printer
you can find at any high school.
											And if not?
											Give it a couple of decades.

											So, a quick aside:
											Remember this slide here?
											Turn your attention to these two words.
											If somebody tries this
and is only 0.1 percent effective,
											eight million people die.
											That&#39;s 2,500 9/11s.
											Civilization would survive,
											but it would be permanently disfigured.
											So this means we need
to be concerned about anybody
											who has the faintest shot on goal,
											not just geniuses.
											So today, there&#39;s a tiny
handful of geniuses
											who probably could make a doomsday bug
											that&#39;s .1-percent effective
and maybe even a little bit more.
											They tend to be stable and successful
and so not part of this group.
											So I guess I&#39;m sorta kinda
barely OK-ish with that.
											But what about after technology improves
											and diffuses
											and thousands of life science
grad students are enabled?
											Are every single one of them
going to be perfectly stable?
											Or how about a few years after that,
											where every stress-ridden
premed is fully enabled?
											At some point in that time frame,
											these circles are going to intersect,
											because we&#39;re now starting to talk about
hundreds of thousands of people
											throughout the world.
											And they recently included that guy
who dressed up like the Joker
											and shot 12 people to death
at a Batman premiere.
											That was a neuroscience PhD student
											with an NIH grant.

Somehow, Rees's wit, warmth and sly optimism turn an objectively terrifying book into fascinating delight.","note":"Martin Rees\r\nBasic Books, 2003","link_url":"https://www.amazon.com/Our-Final-Hour-Scientists-Warning/dp/0465068634/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0520271440&linkCode=as2&tag=teco06-20","position":null,"is_pdf":false,"eyebrow":""},{"label":"READ_Article","headline":"\"The Vulnerable World Hypothesis\"","blurb":"Though challenging, this ingenious 38-page academic paper is quite accessible to any intelligent and truly ambitious reader. If *Our Final Hour* is a ski mountain's gentle yet challenging beginner's slope, \"The Vulnerable World Hypothesis\" is a steep black diamond trail that a determined middling skier can nonetheless navigate. Bostrom weaves an amazing logical tapestry, laying out the choices, game theory and horrifying pitfalls that await us, as the growing cadence of scientific breakthroughs bequeaths us increasingly godlike powers. This amazing work hints that Bostrom could be the world's greatest living logician and futurist.","note":"Nick Bostrom","link_url":"https://nickbostrom.com/papers/vulnerable.pdf","position":null,"is_pdf":false,"eyebrow":""},{"label":"READ_Book","headline":"*A Crack in Creation: Gene Editing and the Unthinkable*","blurb":"A radical new gene-editing technique called CRISPR (and its pending heirs) will eventually touch and even transform every human life. CRISPR's an ancient feature of the natural world, whose day job is helping microorganisms foil infections and parasites. Then in 2013 -- to the head-smacking astonishment of all involved -- it was harnessed, becoming the most powerful gene editing tool ever known to science. Discovering and taming the system was a large-team effort -- but Jennifer was one of its two or three key top contributors. She conveys CRISPR's mechanism of action and breathtaking potential in delightfully accessible prose, while sharing much about her own journey through science and life. Every modern person should understand CRISPR given all it portends -- yet for now, almost no one does.","note":"Jennifer Doudna\r\nHoughton Mifflin Harcourt, 2017","link_url":"https://www.amazon.com/Crack-Creation-Editing-Unthinkable-Evolution-dp-1328915360/dp/1328915360/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0520271440&linkCode=as2&tag=teco06-20","position":null,"is_pdf":false,"eyebrow":""},{"label":"READ_Article","headline":"\"School attacks in China (2010–12)\"","blurb":"This recounting of a spate of ten mass attacks on Chinese schools (which I discuss in my TED talk) shows that America is not unique in suffering this scourge, but also proves that when suicidal mass murderers go all-in, technology is THE force multiplier. The deadliest retail items in China are hammers and knives. As a result, those ten attacks combined killed fewer victims than that one grotesque assault in Newtown, Connecticut -- which, by macabre coincidence, occurred just a few hours after the last of the Chinese attacks. As I've noted elsewhere, the worst suicidal mass murderers are not limited by their consciences or their awful ambitions. They're mostly constrained by the tools they can access. That's knives in China, assault weapons in the US and, in rare but horrifying circumstances, a commercial jet under the command of a suicidal pilot who forces everyone on board to join him in his contemptibly selfish suicide. Far more deadly technologies than airplanes lie in our near future, so this lesson from China is instructive and chilling.","note":"Wikipedia","link_url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_attacks_in_China_(2010%E2%80%9312)","position":null,"is_pdf":false,"eyebrow":""}]}]},"more_resources":[],"corrections":[],"has_citations":true,"take_action":[],"explore_cta_experiment":{},"curator_approved":true,"description":"The world-changing promise of synthetic biology and gene editing has a dark side.
