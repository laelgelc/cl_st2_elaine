<title>Jia Jiang: What I learned from 100 days of rejection | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Jia Jiang adventures boldly into a territory so many of us fear: rejection. By seeking out rejection for 100 days -- from asking a stranger to borrow $100 to requesting a &quot;burger refill&quot; at a restaurant -- Jiang desensitized himself to the pain and shame that rejection often brings and, in the process, discovered that simply asking for what you want can open up possibilities where you expect to find dead ends." />

<meta content='Jia Jiang adventures boldly into a territory so many of us fear: rejection. By seeking out rejection for 100 days — from asking a stranger to borrow $100 to requesting a "burger refill" at a restaurant — Jiang desensitized himself to the pain and shame that rejection often brings and, in the process, discovered that simply asking for what you want can open up possibilities where you expect to find dead ends.' itemprop='description'>

											When I was six years old,
											I received my gifts.
											My first grade teacher
had this brilliant idea.
											She wanted us to experience
receiving gifts
											but also learning the virtue
of complimenting each other.
											So she had all of us
come to the front of the classroom,
											and she bought all of us gifts
and stacked them in the corner.
											And she said,
											&quot;Why don&#39;t we just stand here
and compliment each other?
											If you hear your name called,
											go and pick up your gift and sit down.&quot;
											What a wonderful idea, right?
											What could go wrong?

											Well, there were 40 of us to start with,

someone&#39;s name called,
											I would give out the heartiest cheer.
											And then there were 20 people left,
											and 10 people left,
											and five left ...
											and three left.
											And I was one of them.
											And the compliments stopped.
											Well, at that moment, I was crying.
											And the teacher was freaking out.
											She was like, &quot;Hey, would anyone
say anything nice about these people?&quot;

											But I don&#39;t know who felt worse that day.
											Was it me or the teacher?
											She must have realized
that she turned a team-building event
											into a public roast
for three six-year-olds.
											And without the humor.
											You know, when you see
people get roasted on TV,
											it was funny.

											So that was one version of me,

											Bill Gates came to my hometown —

											I was actually a marketing manager
for a Fortune 500 company.

											Why is that?
											Where is that 14-year-old
who wrote that letter?
											It&#39;s not because he didn&#39;t try.
											It&#39;s because every time I had a new idea,

											even at work —
											I wanted to make a proposal,
											I wanted to speak up
in front of people in a group —
											I felt there was this constant battle

after I started my own company.
											I mean, I started
my own company when I was 30 —
											if you want to be Bill Gates,
											you&#39;ve got to start
sooner or later, right?
											When I was an entrepreneur,
											I was presented
with an investment opportunity,
											and then I was turned down.
											And that rejection hurt me.
											It hurt me so bad
that I wanted to quit right there.
											But then I thought,
											hey, would Bill Gates quit
after a simple investment rejection?
											Would any successful
entrepreneur quit like that?
											No way.
											And this is where it clicked for me.
											OK, I can build a better company.
											I can build a better
team or better product,
											but one thing for sure:
											I&#39;ve got to be a better leader.
											I&#39;ve got to be a better person.
											I cannot let that six-year-old
keep dictating my life anymore.
											I have to put him back in his place.

											&quot;Rejection Therapy&quot; was this game

you go out and look for rejection,

you desensitize yourself from the pain.

started writing emails to me

doing is awesome.&quot;
											But you know, fame and notoriety
did not do anything to me.
											What I really wanted to do was learn,

											And then I learned a lot of things.
											I discovered so many secrets.

											So one day I went to a stranger&#39;s house,

anything I put in the backyard.
											I don&#39;t want to waste your flower.
											If you want to do this,
go across the street and talk to Connie.

after the initial rejection,

the guy didn&#39;t trust me,
											it&#39;s because I was crazy,
											because I didn&#39;t dress up well,
I didn&#39;t look good.
											It was none of those.
											It was because what I offered
did not fit what he wanted.
											And he trusted me enough
to offer me a referral,

											So for example,
one day I went to a Starbucks,
											and asked the manager,
&quot;Hey, can I be a Starbucks greeter?&quot;
											He was like, &quot;What&#39;s a Starbucks greeter?&quot;
											I said, &quot;Do you know
those Walmart greeters?
											You know, those people who say

											yeah, this is how he looked,
his name is Eric —
											and he was like, &quot;I&#39;m not sure.&quot;
											This is how he was hearing me. &quot;Not sure.&quot;

											He&#39;s like, &quot;Yeah, it&#39;s really weird, man.&quot;
											But as soon as he said that,
his whole demeanor changed.

											It was really boring.

											And because I mentioned, &quot;Is that weird?&quot;,
that means I wasn&#39;t weird.
											That means I was actually
thinking just like him,
											seeing this as a weird thing.
											And again, and again,

some doubt people might have

									<p>
											But I wanted to be
an entrepreneur, so I didn&#39;t.
											But it has always been my dream
to actually teach something.
											So I said, &quot;What if I just ask
											and teach a college class?&quot;
											I lived in Austin at the time,
											so I went to University
of Texas at Austin
											and knocked on professors&#39; doors
and said, &quot;Can I teach your class?&quot;
											I didn&#39;t get anywhere

											But because I didn&#39;t run —
I kept doing it —

has done this before.&quot;

which you can&#39;t see,

											Why? Because in my research I found
that people who really change the world,
											who change the way we live
and the way we think,
											are the people who were met
with initial and often violent rejections.
											People like Martin Luther King, Jr.,
											like Mahatma Gandhi, Nelson Mandela,
											or even Jesus Christ.
											These people did not
let rejection define them.
											They let their own reaction
after rejection define themselves.

He is also the CEO of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.wujulearning.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Wuju Learning</a>, a company that teaches people and trains organizations to become fearless through rejection training. In 2015, he authored a bestselling book,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://geni.us/mFqe\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Rejection Proof: How I Beat Fear and Became Invincible Through 100 Days of Rejection</em></a>.</p><p>Several years after Jiang began his career in the corporate world, he took a life-altering risk and stepped into the unknown world of entrepreneurship. His result was everyone&#39;s biggest fear: rejection. This was the catalyst that set Jiang on the path to his true calling.</p><p>To conquer the fear of rejection, Jiang embarked on a personal quest and started a blog,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://rejectiontherapy.com/100-days-of-rejection-therapy/\" target=\"_blank\">100 Days of Rejection Therapy</a>. His journey revealed a world that was hidden in plain sight --&nbsp;a world where people are much kinder than we imagine. He discovered that rejection can be much less painful than we believe&nbsp;and that the fear of rejection is much more destructive than we know.</p><p>Jiang grew up in Beijing, China and migrated to the United States at age 16. He holds a Bachelor of Computer Science from Brigham Young University and a Master of Business Administration from Duke University.</p>"}],"speaker_name":"Jia Jiang","tags":["adventure","creativity","curiosity","failure","fear","goal-setting","humanity","innovation","entrepreneur","life","motivation","personal growth","sociology","TEDx","teaching"],"title":"What I learned from 100 days of rejection","video_type":{"id":"2","name":"TEDx Talk"},"viewed_count":5737871}]}})</script></div>
