											I&#39;m going to talk about the simple truth in leadership
											in the 21st century.
											In the 21st century, we need to actually look at —
											and what I&#39;m actually going to encourage you to consider today —
											is to go back to our school days
											when we learned how to count.
											But I think it&#39;s time for us to think about what we count.
											Because what we actually count
											truly counts.

											Let me start by telling you a little story.
											This is Van Quach.
											She came to this country in 1986 from Vietnam.
											She changed her name to Vivian
											because she wanted to fit in here in America.
											Her first job was at an inner-city motel
											in San Francisco as a maid.
											I happened to buy that motel
											about three months after Vivian started working there.
											So Vivian and I have been working together for 23 years.

									<p>
											With the youthful idealism of a 26-year-old,
											in 1987,
											I started my company and I called it Joie de Vivre,
											a very impractical name,
											because I actually was looking to create joy of life.
											And this first hotel that I bought, motel,
											was a pay-by-the-hour, no-tell motel
											in the inner-city of San Francisco.
											As I spent time with Vivian,
											I saw that she had sort of a joie de vivre
											in how she did her work.
											It made me question and curious:
											How could someone actually find joy
											in cleaning toilets for a living?
											So I spent time with Vivian, and I saw that
											she didn&#39;t find joy in cleaning toilets.
											Her job, her goal and her calling
											was not to become the world&#39;s greatest toilet scrubber.
											What counts for Vivian was the emotional connection
											she created with her fellow employees and our guests.
											And what gave her inspiration and meaning
											was the fact that she was taking care of people
											who were far away from home.
											Because Vivian knew what it was like to be far away from home.

											That very human lesson,
											more than 20 years ago,
											served me well during the last
											economic downturn we had.
											In the wake of the dotcom crash and 9/11,
											San Francisco Bay Area hotels
											went through the largest percentage revenue drop
											in the history of American hotels.
											We were the largest operator of hotels in the Bay Area,
											so we were particularly vulnerable.
											But also back then,
											remember we stopped eating French fries in this country.
											Well, not exactly, of course not.
											We started eating &quot;freedom fries,&quot;
											and we started boycotting anything that was French.
											Well, my name of my company, Joie de Vivre —
											so I started getting these letters
											from places like Alabama and Orange County
											saying to me that they were going to boycott my company
											because they thought we were a French company.
											And I&#39;d write them back, and I&#39;d say, &quot;What a minute. We&#39;re not French.
											We&#39;re an American company. We&#39;re based in San Francisco.&quot;
											And I&#39;d get a terse response: &quot;Oh, that&#39;s worse.&quot;

											So one particular day
											when I was feeling a little depressed and not a lot of joie de vivre,
											I ended up in the local bookstore around the corner from our offices.
											And I initially ended up in the business section of the bookstore
											looking for a business solution.
											But given my befuddled state of mind, I ended up
											in the self-help section very quickly.
											That&#39;s where I got reacquainted with
											Abraham Maslow&#39;s &quot;hierarchy of needs.&quot;
											I took one psychology class in college,
											and I learned about this guy, Abraham Maslow,
											as many of us are familiar with his hierarchy of needs.
											But as I sat there for four hours,
											the full afternoon, reading Maslow,
											I recognized something
											that is true of most leaders.
											One of the simplest facts in business
											is something that we often neglect,
											and that is that we&#39;re all human.
											Each of us, no matter what our role is in business,
											has some hierarchy of needs
											in the workplace.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So as I started reading more Maslow,
											what I started to realize is that
											Maslow, later in his life,
											wanted to take this hierarchy for the individual
											and apply it to the collective,
											to organizations and specifically to business.
											But unfortunately, he died prematurely in 1970,
											and so he wasn&#39;t really able to live that dream completely.
											So I realized in that dotcom crash
											that my role in life was to channel Abe Maslow.
											And that&#39;s what I did a few years ago
											when I took that five-level hierarchy of needs pyramid
											and turned it into what I call the transformation pyramid,
											which is survival, success and transformation.
											It&#39;s not just fundamental in business, it&#39;s fundamental in life.
											And we started asking ourselves the questions
											about how we were actually addressing
											the higher needs, these transformational needs
											for our key employees in the company.
											These three levels of the hierarchy needs
											relate to the five levels
											of Maslow&#39;s hierarchy of needs.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											But as we started asking ourselves about how we were addressing
											the higher needs of our employees and our customers,
											I realized we had no metrics.
											We had nothing that actually could tell us whether we were actually getting it right.
											So we started asking ourselves:
											What kind of less obvious metrics
											could we use to actually evaluate
											our employees&#39; sense of meaning,
											or our customers&#39; sense of emotional connection with us?
											For example, we actually started asking our employees,
											do they understand the mission of our company,
											and do they feel like they believe in it,
											can they actually influence it,
											and do they feel that their work actually has an impact on it?
											We started asking our customers,
											did they feel an emotional connection with us,
											in one of seven different kinds of ways.
											Miraculously, as we asked these questions
											and started giving attention higher up the pyramid,
											what we found is we created more loyalty.
											Our customer loyalty skyrocketed.
											Our employee turnover dropped
											to one-third of the industry average,
											and during that five year dotcom bust,
											we tripled in size.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											As I went out and started spending time with other leaders out there
											and asking them how they were getting through that time,
											what they told me over and over again
											was that they just manage what they can measure.
											What we can measure is that tangible stuff
											at the bottom of the pyramid.
											They didn&#39;t even see the intangible stuff
											higher up the pyramid.
											So I started asking myself the question:
											How can we get leaders to start valuing the intangible?
											If we&#39;re taught as leaders to just manage what we can measure,
											and all we can measure is the tangible in life,
											we&#39;re missing a whole lot of things at the top of the pyramid.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So I went out and studied a bunch of things,
											and I found a survey that showed
											that 94 percent
											of business leaders worldwide
											believe that the intangibles are important in their business,
											things like intellectual property,
											their corporate culture, their brand loyalty,
											and yet, only five percent of those same leaders
											actually had a means of measuring the intangibles in their business.
											So as leaders, we understand
											that intangibles are important,
											but we don&#39;t have a clue how to measure them.
											So here&#39;s another Einstein quote:
											&quot;Not everything that can be counted counts,
											and not everything that counts can be counted.&quot;
											I hate to argue with Einstein,
											but if that which is most valuable
											in our life and our business
											actually can&#39;t be counted or valued,
											aren&#39;t we going to spend our lives
											just mired in measuring the mundane?

											It was that sort of heady question about what counts
											that led me to take my CEO hat off for a week
											and fly off to the Himalayan peaks.
											I flew off to a place that&#39;s been shrouded in mystery for centuries,
											a place some folks call Shangri-La.
											It&#39;s actually moved from the survival base of the pyramid
											to becoming a transformational
											role model for the world.
											I went to Bhutan.
											The teenage king of Bhutan was also a curious man,
											but this was back in 1972,
											when he ascended to the throne
											two days after his father passed away.
											At age 17, he started asking the kinds of questions
											that you&#39;d expect of someone with a beginner&#39;s mind.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											On a trip through India,
											early in his reign as king,
											he was asked by an Indian journalist
											about the Bhutanese GDP,
											the size of the Bhutanese GDP.
											The king responded in a fashion
											that actually has transformed us four decades later.
											He said the following, he said: &quot;Why are we so obsessed
											and focused with gross domestic product?
											Why don&#39;t we care more about
											gross national happiness?&quot;
											Now, in essence, the king was asking us to consider
											an alternative definition of success,
											what has come to be known as
											GNH, or gross national happiness.
											Most world leaders didn&#39;t take notice,
											and those that did thought this was just &quot;Buddhist economics.&quot;
											But the king was serious.
											This was a notable moment,
											because this was the first time a world leader
											in almost 200 years
											had suggested
											that intangible of happiness —
											that leader 200 years ago,
											Thomas Jefferson with the Declaration of Independence —
											200 years later,
											this king was suggesting that intangible of happiness
											is something that we should measure,
											and it&#39;s something we should actually value
											as government officials.

											For the next three dozen years as king,
											this king actually started measuring
											and managing around happiness in Bhutan —
											including, just recently, taking his country
											from being an absolute monarchy to a constitutional monarchy

											Bhutan, for those of you who don&#39;t know it,

											So as I spent time with leaders in the GNH movement,
											I got to really understand what they&#39;re doing.
											And I got to spend some time with the prime minister.
											Over dinner, I asked him an impertinent question.
											I asked him,
											&quot;How can you create and measure
											something which evaporates —
											in other words, happiness?&quot;
											And he&#39;s a very wise man, and he said,
											&quot;Listen, Bhutan&#39;s goal is not to create happiness.
											We create the conditions for happiness to occur.
											In other words, we create a habitat of happiness.&quot;
											Wow, that&#39;s interesting.
											He said that they have a science behind that art,
											and they&#39;ve actually created four essential pillars,
											nine key indicators
											and 72 different metrics
											that help them to measure their GNH.
											One of those key indicators is:
											How do the Bhutanese feel about
											how they spend their time each day?
											It&#39;s a good question. How do you feel about
											how you spend your time each day?
											Time is one of the scarcest resources
											in the modern world.
											And yet, of course,
											that little intangible piece of data
											doesn&#39;t factor into our GDP calculations.

											As I spent my week up in the Himalayas,
											I started to imagine
											what I call an emotional equation.
											And it focuses on something I read long ago
											from a guy named Rabbi Hyman Schachtel.
											How many know him? Anybody?
											1954, he wrote a book called &quot;The Real Enjoyment of Living,&quot;
											and he suggested that happiness
											is not about having what you want;
											instead, it&#39;s about wanting what you have.
											Or in other words, I think the Bhutanese believe
											happiness equals wanting what you have —
											imagine gratitude —
											divided by having what you want —
											gratification.
											The Bhutanese aren&#39;t on some aspirational treadmill,
											constantly focused on what they don&#39;t have.
											Their religion, their isolation,
											their deep respect for their culture
											and now the principles of their GNH movement
											all have fostered a sense of gratitude
											about what they do have.
											How many of us here, as TEDsters in the audience,
											spend more of our time
											in the bottom half of this equation, in the denominator?
											We are a bottom-heavy culture
											in more ways than one.

											Actually, in fact, if you look in the dictionary,

											This is Dave Arringdale who&#39;s actually
											been a longtime guest at Vivian&#39;s motel.
											He stayed there a hundred times
											in the last 20 years,
											and he&#39;s loyal to the property because of the relationship
											that Vivian and her fellow employees have created with him.
											They&#39;ve created a habitat of happiness for Dave.
											He tells me that he can always count
											on Vivian and the staff there
											to make him feel at home.
											Why is it that
											business leaders and investors
											quite often don&#39;t see the connection
											between creating the intangible
											of employee happiness
											with creating the tangible
											of financial profits in their business?
											We don&#39;t have to choose between
											inspired employees and sizable profits,
											we can have both.
											In fact, inspired employees quite often
											help make sizable profits, right?

											So what the world needs now,
											in my opinion,
											is business leaders and political leaders
											who know what to count.
											We count numbers.
											We count on people.
											What really counts is when we actually use our numbers
											to truly take into account our people.
											I learned that from a maid in a motel
											and a king of a country.
											What can you
											start counting today?
											What one thing can you start counting today
											that actually would be meaningful in your life,
											whether it&#39;s your work life or your business life?

His previous books,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Peak-Great-Companies-Their-Maslow/dp/0787988618\" target=\"_blank\"><em>PEAK</em></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Emotional-Equations-Creating-Happiness-Business/dp/1451607261\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Emotional Equations</em></a>, are inspired by the works of famed psychologists Abraham Maslow and Viktor Frankl and their theories on transformation and meaning.</p><p>Conley is the founder of the world&#39;s first &quot;midlife wisdom school,&quot; the Modern Elder Academy in Baja California Sur, Mexico, where students learn how to repurpose a lifetime of experience. He&#39;s also the founder of Fest300 (part of Everfest) and San Francisco&#39;s Celebrity Pool Toss and Hotel Hero Awards. Conley&nbsp;holds a BA and MBA from Stanford University, and an honorary doctorate in psychology from Saybrook University. He serves on the boards of the Burning Man Project and the Esalen Institute, home of the Conley Library.</p><p>Photo: Marc Olivier Leblanc</p>"}],"speaker_name":"Chip Conley","tags":["Buddhism","business","economics","happiness","money","psychology"],"title":"Measuring what makes life worthwhile","video_type":{"id":"1","name":"TED Stage Talk"},"viewed_count":3157828}]}})</script></div>
