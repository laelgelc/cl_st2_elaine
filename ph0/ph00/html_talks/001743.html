											I spend most of my time
											thinking about little girls,
											which is kind of a weird thing
for a grown man in our society to say.
											But I do. I spend most of my time
thinking about little girls,
											and I think it&#39;s primarily
because I have one.
											This one&#39;s mine, and I think
you would really like her.
											She is smart and funny
											and kind to people and a good friend.
											But when I talk about my daughter,
the word I find myself saying most
											is &quot;athlete.&quot;
											My kid&#39;s athletic.
											She is strong and fast
											and has great balance
and good body control.
											She is a three-time,
back-to-back-to-back state champion
											in Shaolin Kempo.
											At nine years old, she is already
halfway to a black belt.
											My daughter is athletic.

											But here&#39;s the question
that I have to ask.
											Why is it that when
my daughter dresses up,
											whether it&#39;s Groot or The Incredible Hulk,
											whether it&#39;s Obi-Wan Kenobi or Darth Maul,
											why is every character
she dresses up as a boy?
											And where are all the female superheroes?
											And that is not actually the question,
											because there&#39;s plenty
of female superheroes.
											My question really is,
where is all the female superhero stuff?
											Where are the costumes?
Where are the toys?

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Because every day when my daughter
plays when she dresses up,
											she&#39;s learning stuff
											through a process that,
in my own line of work,
											as a professor of media studies,
											we refer to as public pedagogy.
											That is, it is how societies
are taught ideologies.
											It&#39;s how you learned what it meant
to be a man or a woman,
											what it meant to behave
yourself in public,
											what it meant to be a patriot
and have good manners.
											It&#39;s all the constituent social relations
that make us up as a people.
											It&#39;s, in short, how we learn
what we know about other people
											and about the world.
											But we live in a 100-percent
media-saturated society.
											What that means is that every single
aspect of your human existence
											outside of your basic bodily functions
											is in some way touched by media.
											From the car that you drive
to the food that you eat
											to the clothes that you wear
											to the way you construct
your relationships
											to the very language
you use to formulate thought —
											all of that is in some way mediated.
											So the answer in our society
											to how do we learn what we know
about other people and about the world
											is largely through media.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Well, there&#39;s a wrinkle in that,
											in that our society,
											media don&#39;t simply exist as information
distribution technologies and devices.
											They also exist as corporate entities.
											And when the distribution of information
is tied to financial gain,
											there&#39;s a problem.
											How big of a problem?
											Well think about this:
											in 1983, 90 percent of American media
were owned by 50 companies.
											In any market, 50 companies
doing something is a lot of companies.
											It&#39;s a lot of different worldviews.
											In 2015, that number has shrunk to six,
											six companies.
											They are NBCUniversal Comcast,
AOL Time Warner,
											the Walt Disney Company, News Corp,
Viacom and the CBS Corporation.
											These six companies produce
nine out of every 10 movies you watch,
											nine out of every 10 television shows,
nine out of every 10 songs,
											nine out of every 10 books.
											So my question to you is,
											if six companies control
90 percent of American media,
											how much influence do you think they have
over what you&#39;re allowed to see every day?

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Because in media studies,
											we spend a lot of time saying
that media can&#39;t tell us what to think,
											and they can&#39;t; they&#39;re terrible at that.
											But that&#39;s not their job.
											Media don&#39;t tell us what to think.
											Media tell us what to think about.
											They control the conversation,
											and in controlling the conversation,
											they don&#39;t have to get you
to think what they want you to think.
											They&#39;ll just get you thinking about
the things they want you to think about,
											and more importantly, not thinking about
things they don&#39;t want you to think about.
											They control the conversation.

									<p>
											How does this work in practice?
											Let&#39;s just take one of those companies.
											We&#39;ll do an easy one.
											Let&#39;s talk about the Walt Disney
Company for a second.
											The reason why I always pick
the Walt Disney Company is this.
											Is there a single person in this room
who has never seen a Disney movie?
											Look around. Exactly.
											I picked Disney because they have
what we call 100 percent penetration
											in our society.
											Every single person
has been exposed to Disney,
											so it&#39;s an easy one for me to use.
											Since 1937, Disney has made most
of its money selling princesses to girls.
											It&#39;s made a huge chunk of its money.
											Unless, of course, the princess
your daughter is interested in,
											as my daughter is, is this one.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											See, in 2012,
											Disney purchased LucasFilm
for the sum of four billion dollars,
											and immediately they flooded
the Disney stores with Han Solo
											and Obi-Wan Kenobi, with Darth Vader
and Luke Skywalker and Yoda
											and not Princess Leia.
											Why? Because this princess
messes up the public pedagogy
											for these princesses.
											So Disney did not put Princess Leia
merchandise in the store,
											and when people went to Disney and said,
											&quot;Hey, where&#39;s all
the Princess Leia stuff?&quot;
											Disney said, &quot;We have no intention
											of putting Princess Leia
merchandise in the store.&quot;
											And fans were angry
and they took to Twitter
											with the hashtag #WeWantLeia.
											And Disney said,
&quot;Wait, that&#39;s not what we meant.
											What we meant was,
											we don&#39;t have any Princess Leia
merchandise yet, but we will.&quot;
											And that was in 2012, and it is 2015,
											and if you go to the Disney Store,
as I recently have,
											and look for Princess Leia merchandise,
											do you know how many Princess Leia
items there are in the Disney Store?
											Zero, because Disney has no intention
of putting Princess Leia in the store.

									<p>
											And we shouldn&#39;t be surprised
because we found out that was their policy
											when they bought Marvel in 2009
											for the sum of 4.5 billion dollars.
											Because when you make a lot of money
selling princesses to girls,
											you also kind of want
to make money from boys.
											And so what better to sell boys
than superheroes?
											So now Disney had access
to Captain America and to Thor,
											The Incredible Hulk,
											and they had access even
											to a group of superheroes
no one had ever even heard of.
											That&#39;s how good Marvel was
at selling superheroes.

											Last year, they released a film

											So like any good nerd dad,
I went to buy my daughter Gamora stuff,
											and when I got to the store,
I learned a very interesting thing.
											If I wanted to buy her a Gamora backpack,
											well, Gamora&#39;s not on it.

											Now, I could have taken to Twitter
with the hashtag #WheresGamora,

across the world,

I wasn&#39;t even really that surprised,
											because I was there
when Disney had released &quot;The Avengers.&quot;

a new Avengers movie, the &quot;Age of Ultron,&quot;

but two female superheroes,

											But here&#39;s the real thing about this.
											Even though Scarlett Johansson,
											who is one of the most popular
actresses in America, plays Black Widow,
											and Black Widow is the star
											of not one, not two,
but five different Marvel movies,
											there is not a single piece
of Black Widow merchandise available.
											Not one.
											And if you go to the Disney store
and look for a Black Widow costume,
											what you will find, is you will find
Captain America and The Incredible Hulk.
											You will find Iron Man and Thor.
											You will even find War Machine,
											who isn&#39;t even really
in the movie that long.
											Who you will not find is Black Widow.
											And I could have gone to Twitter
with the hashtag, as many people did,
											# WheresNatasha.

											And so what is this teaching us?
											I mean, over the next five years,
											Disney and Warner Bros.
and a bunch of movie studios
											are going to release
over 30 feature-length films
											with comic book characters,
											and of those 30 feature-length films,
											exactly two of them
will have female solo leads.
											Two.
											Now, there will be females
in the rest of these movies,

they will be love interests,
											they will be members of teams.
											They will not be the main character.
											And if what we learn, what we know

we learn through media,
											then these companies are teaching
my daughter that even if she is strong
											and smart and fast
and fights like a ninja,
											all four of which are true of her,
											it doesn&#39;t matter.
											She will either be ignored like Gamora
