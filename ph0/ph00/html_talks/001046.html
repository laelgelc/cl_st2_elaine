<title>Robin Steinberg: What if we ended the injustice of bail? | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: On any given night, more than 450,000 people in the United States are locked up in jail simply because they don&#39;t have enough money to pay bail. The sums in question are often around $500: easy for some to pay, impossible for others. This has real human consequences -- people lose jobs, homes and lives, and it drives racial disparities in the legal system. Robin Steinberg has a bold idea to change this. In this powerful talk, she outlines the plan for The Bail Project -- an unprecedented national revolving bail fund to fight mass incarceration. (This ambitious idea is part of the Audacious Project, TED&#39;s initiative to inspire and fund global change.)" />

<meta content='What if we ended the injustice of bail?' itemprop='name'>
<meta content="On any given night, more than 450,000 people in the United States are locked up in jail simply because they don't have enough money to pay bail. The sums in question are often around $500: easy for some to pay, impossible for others. This has real human consequences — people lose jobs, homes and lives, and it drives racial disparities in the legal system. Robin Steinberg has a bold idea to change this. In this powerful talk, she outlines the plan for The Bail Project — an unprecedented national revolving bail fund to fight mass incarceration. (This ambitious idea is part of the Audacious Project, TED's initiative to inspire and fund global change.)" itemprop='description'>

											I will never forget the first time
I visited a client in jail.
											The heavy, metal door slammed behind me,
											and I heard the key turn in the lock.
											The cement floor underneath me
had a sticky film on it
											that made a ripping sound,
											like tape being pulled off a box,
											every time I moved my foot.
											The only connection to the outside world
was a small window placed too high to see.
											There was a small, square table
bolted to the floor
											and two metal chairs,
											one on either side.
											That was the first time
I understood viscerally —
											just for a fleeting moment —
											what incarceration might feel like.
											And I promised myself all those years ago
as a young, public defender
											that I would never,
ever forget that feeling.
											And I never have.
											It inspired me to fight for each
and every one of my clients&#39; freedom
											as if it was my own.

											Freedom.
											A concept so fundamental
to the American psyche
											that it is enshrined in our constitution.
											And yet, America is addicted
to imprisonment.
											From slavery through mass incarceration,
											it always has been.
											Look, we all know the shocking numbers.
											The United States incarcerates
more people per capita
											than almost any nation on the planet.
											But what you may not know
is that on any given night in America,
											almost half a million people go to sleep
in those concrete jail cells
											who have not been convicted of anything.
											These mothers and fathers
and sons and daughters
											are there for one reason
and one reason only:
											they cannot afford to pay
the price of their freedom.
											And that price is called bail.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now, bail was actually created
as a form of conditional release.
											The theory was simple:
											set bail at an amount
that somebody could afford to pay —
											they would pay it —
											it would give them an incentive
to come back to court;
											it would give them some skin in the game.
											Bail was never intended
to be used as punishment.
											Bail was never intended
to hold people in jail cells.
											And bail was never, ever intended
to create a two-tier system of justice:
											one for the rich
and one for everybody else.
											But that is precisely what it has done.

											Seventy-five percent of people
in American local jails
											are there because they cannot pay bail.
											People like Ramel.
											On a chilly October afternoon,
											Ramel was riding his bicycle
in his South Bronx neighborhood
											on his way to a market
to pick up a quart of milk.
											He was stopped by the police.
											And when he demanded to know
why he was being stopped,
											an argument ensued,
and the next thing he knew,
											he was on the ground in handcuffs,
											being charged with &quot;riding
your bicycle on the sidewalk
											and resisting arrest.&quot;
											He was taken to court,
											where a judge set 500 dollars bail.
											But Ramel — he didn&#39;t have 500 dollars.
											So this 32-year-old father
was sent to &quot;The Boat&quot; —
											a floating jail barge
that sits on the East River
											between a sewage plant and a fish market.
											That&#39;s right, you heard me.
											In New York City, in 2018,
											we have a floating prison barge
that sits out there
											and houses primarily black and brown men
											who cannot pay their bail.

											Let&#39;s talk for a moment
											about what it means to be in jail
even for a few days.
											Well, it can mean losing your job,
											losing your home,
											jeopardizing your immigration status.
											It may even mean
losing custody of your children.
											A third of sexual
victimization by jail staff
											happens in the first three days in jail,
											and almost half of all jail deaths,
including suicides,
											happen in that first week.
											What&#39;s more,
if you&#39;re held in jail on bail,
											you&#39;re four times more likely
to get a jail sentence
											than if you had been free,
											and that jail sentence
will be three times longer.
											And if you are black or Latino
and cash bail has been set,
											you are two times more likely
to remain stuck in that jail cell
											than if you were white.

											Jail in America is a terrifying,
dehumanizing and violent experience.
											Now imagine for just one moment
that it&#39;s you stuck in that jail cell,
											and you don&#39;t have
the 500 dollars to get out.
											And someone comes along
and offers you a way out.
											&quot;Just plead guilty,&quot; they say.
											&quot;You can go home back to your job.
											Just plead guilty.
											You can kiss your kids goodnight tonight.&quot;
											So you do what anybody
would do in that situation.
											You plead guilty
whether you did it or not.
											But now you have a criminal record
											that&#39;s going to follow you
for the rest of your life.

											Jailing people because they don&#39;t have
enough money to pay bail
											is one of the most unfair,
immoral things we do as a society.
											But it is also expensive
and counterproductive.
											American taxpayers —
											they spend 14 billion dollars annually
holding people in jail cells
											who haven&#39;t been convicted of anything.
											That&#39;s 40 million dollars a day.
											What&#39;s perhaps more confounding
is it doesn&#39;t make us any safer.
											Research is clear
that holding somebody in jail
											makes you significantly more likely
to commit a crime when you get out
											than if you had been free all along.

											Freedom makes all the difference.
											Low-income communities

											Together, they have pooled their resources
to buy their loved ones freedom
											for as long as bondage
and jail cells existed.
											But the reach of the criminal legal system
has grown too enormous,

I was wrestling with over a decade ago

with my husband, David,

											We were eating our Chinese takeout
and venting about the injustice of it all
											when David looked up and said,

our clients out of jail?&quot;

to lose all of the money.
											People wouldn&#39;t come back
because they didn&#39;t have any stake in it.
											But what if clients did come back?
											We knew that bail money comes back
at the end of a criminal case,
											so it could come back into the fund,
											and we could use it over and over again
for more and more bail.
											That was our big bet,

has exploded our ideas
											of why people come back to court
											and how the criminal
legal system itself is operated.
											Turns out money isn&#39;t what makes
people come back to court.
											We know this because when
the Bronx Freedom Fund pays bail,
											96 percent of clients
return for every court appearance,
											laying waste to the myth
that it&#39;s money that mattered.
											It&#39;s powerful evidence
that we don&#39;t need cash

											or unnecessary systems
of surveillance and supervision.

It was hard work, but I woke up everyday inspired and with a sense of purpose -- even when the unfairness of the system made me cry. I was doing my part in the larger struggle for social justice -- one client at a time. But the need to do more, to rethink the very nature of public defense and challenge the larger systemic issues that fueled the cycle of criminalization and poverty led me to start The Bronx Defenders in 1997.
