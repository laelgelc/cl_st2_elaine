									<p>
											Who can we trust to tell us the truth?
											Once in another tumultuous era,
											as the Vietnam War, Watergate,
											the Civil Rights and
Women&#39;s Liberation Movements
											were challenging America to its core,
											my dad and I would watch Walter Cronkite,
											a man he trusted to tell us
what was happening.
											Dad, a politically conservative
career military man,
											cared a lot about this country
											and was determined to make sure
he was well informed.
											He listened to the radio every morning,
read the paper every afternoon,
											and watched the news on TV every evening
before sitting down to dinner,
											or at some point,
											he would almost always launch a debate
about what was happening in the world.
											He&#39;d pound the table
and say something like
											&quot;Don&#39;t those Vietnam war protesters
know it&#39;s my country, right or wrong?&quot;
											And I&#39;d react with something like
&quot;But, Dad, don&#39;t they have a point?
											I mean, what are we doing in Vietnam?&quot;
											And he&#39;d puff up and get red in the face
and respond with something like
											&quot;I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m hearing those words
out of the mouth of my own daughter.&quot;
											(Laughter)
											Our arguments could get so loud,
											my brothers and sisters
would sometimes pick up their plates
											to eat somewhere else.
											Dad really liked to win these arguments.
											But even when he didn&#39;t,
he&#39;d respect my opinion.
											Sometimes, he would even say,
											&quot;Ann, I don&#39;t always agree with you,
											but I&#39;d still vote for you for President.&quot;
											(Laughter)
											(Applause)
											There were times, however,
											usually when Walter was off
and someone else was substituting,
											when Dad would hear something
on the evening news
											that would alarm him
far more than the stories of the day.
											All it would take was one phrase,
a changed tone of voice,
											a raised eyebrow,
											or even just a single word
that struck Dad as opinionated,
											and he was offended.
											Suddenly, he was shaking his finger
at the television set, shouting,
											&quot;Stop telling me what to think!
Just give me the facts!&quot;
											And then he would look over at me and say,
											&quot;See, Ann? He&#39;s disrespecting us,
											trying to tell us what to think
as if we were stupid
											and can&#39;t make up our own minds.&quot;
											Boy, if my dad could see what counts
for some of TV journalism today.
											(Laughter)
											(Applause)
											He would want to be right up here with me,
standing right next to me,
											suggesting an idea
that might be worth spreading.
											Journalism is only trustworthy
											when it dependably offers
accurate, verifiable facts,
											not bias and speculation,
											and not for ratings, circulation or clicks
											(Applause)
											or for any financial
or political motivation,
											but with one motive and one motive only:
											to reveal the truth
for the greater public good.
											The bridge to trust is truth,
and it&#39;s time to make things right.
											(Applause) (Cheers)
											What do we define as truth?
											Well, lately I&#39;ve wondered
if we&#39;ve all gotten a little confused
											about what truth is and what it isn&#39;t.
											People ask, &quot;Whose truth?&quot;
											uncertain if objective,
absolute truth even exists,
											thinking, as some
philosophers have argued,
											that as it requires human judgment,
truth is ultimately subjective.
											As others see it, reporters
can&#39;t be fair and unbiased,
											because being humans,
of course they have opinions
											and so should at least tell us
what those opinions are.
											Other people, who&#39;ve noticed
objective facts now seem less influential
											than emotion and personal beliefs
in shaping public opinion,
											have gone so far as to say
we live in a post-truth era.
											To all this, my dad
would say, &quot;Balderdash!&quot;
											(Laughter)
											He was a Navy man
who didn&#39;t like to swear -
											go figure.
											I, however, don&#39;t seem
to have that problem.
											(Laughter) (Applause)
											So maybe I should just
call it what it is:
											FUBAR -
											Fucked Up Beyond All Recognition.
											(Applause) (Cheers)
											I appreciate philosophers,
but not being one,
											I can&#39;t settle the &quot;Is truth
subjective or objective?&quot; debate.
											Though it does seem
to be an objective, verifiable fact
											that I&#39;m standing on this stage
											and that I&#39;m a little nervous,
worried that I may have overdressed,
											and I&#39;m wishing that I wore
more comfortable shoes.
											(Laughter)
											There is actually compelling evidence
that humans can be fair and impartial,
											not just from the ancient biblical story
of Solomon, but from the known science,
											which tell us that fairness
along with empathy
											are fundamental human traits,
deeply rooted in our genetics.
											If it wasn&#39;t for these traits,
											we might not even be able
to live amongst each other.
											And as a reporter,
											I know you can get in so deep,
											listening to and documenting
all sides of the story,
											searching for the truth,
											that you don&#39;t even know
what your own opinion is.
											I know because I&#39;ve done it.
											And because we as a species
cannot live long,
											cannot long endure 
without objective facts,
											unelaborated and unvarnished,
											it can be argued they still
and will always matter.
											We need truth.
											Perhaps especially from journalism,
											which, when practiced well,
											can help us see each other
and ourselves more honestly,
											tell us what we need to know
to be smarter citizens,
											show us how to live healthier
and more connected lives,
											and even warn us
											when we need to keep ourselves
and our loved ones safe from danger.
											Post-truth?
											Really?
											We do seem to be experiencing
a loss of credibility,
											a demise in the face
of a rising tide of lies,
											in our ability to trust

											what we&#39;re told are objective facts
are either objective or facts.
											Where does the information
											that&#39;s sowing this distrust
and confusion come from?
											And what is it doing to us and the quality
of our relationships with each other?
											Instead of a Walter Cronkite today,
											i.e., someone who a significant
number of people trust,
											we are exposed to an overwhelming number
of sources of information
											on multiple platforms,
											working around the clock
to get our attention,
											some motivated to purposely
manipulate us with lies and propaganda,
											some inept, shelling out incomplete,
misleading or poorly-sourced information
											and some doing exemplary reporting
											but still doubted almost as much
for any mistakes or perceived bias.
											The net impact of all of this
is a chaotic overload
											of competing, conflicting
and confusing information.
											And while our brains
are truly excellent at collecting data,
											we&#39;re not always so great
at remembering where we got it.
											So what we learn from a trusted source
can easily get jumbled up in our brains
											with what we read on a website,
											saw in a tweet
											or a video posted on Facebook
											or heard from a pundit
speculating on cable television.
											If you ever saw the David Bowie movie
&quot;The Man Who Fell to Earth&quot; -
											I sometimes feel we&#39;re all in that scene
											in which he&#39;s watching
a huge wall of TV monitors,
											each one tuned to a different channel,
											and suddenly, he can&#39;t take it anymore,
											and he starts yelling,
											&quot;Get out of my mind, all of you!&quot;
											Bet you didn&#39;t expect
a David Bowie reference today.
											(Laughter)
											Perhaps never before have so many
consumed so much news
											and yet have been so woefully misinformed.
											When, in this swirling chaos,
											can we be certain the information
we need or want to know is accurate?
											The internet is an abyss
as well as a wonderland.
											It mirrors the darkest dark in us
											and the brightest light of humanity
											and all there is in between.
											And because of it, no matter
what comes next in journalism,
											there now seems no doubt
that you and me and every one of us
											must become a better editor.
											So here, from one journalist&#39;s playbook,
											are some tried and true strategies
that might up your game.
											Focus on defense
											and develop a skill
for listening to both sides of a story
											even if it pains you.
											Realize -
											(Applause)
											Realize virtually every source
											wants a story told as he or she sees it.
											That means even seemingly
good, honest people
											can tell you just the facts
that support their point of view,
											sometimes leaving out key details.
											They might even distort the facts,
											purposely misdirect you
											or even out-and-out lie.
											Ask yourself, &quot;What&#39;s the motivating force
for this source to tell the story?&quot;
											And could that motivation be influencing
the story that you&#39;re getting?
											Then ask, &quot;Is this source in a position,
											having been an eyewitness
or having some expertise,
											to even know what is true?&quot;
											Or is he or she wasting your time
with speculation?
											And because even eyewitnesses
and experts can get it wrong,
											you have to seek out sources
from other points of view
											and then critically examine
their motivations and credibility as well.
											Rarely is the truth one-sided;
											it tends to be nuanced.
											(Applause)
											And it&#39;s not always fair.
											But you may never find it
unless you search fairly,
											with a mind that is truly open.
											And then, even if you think
you have a balanced view of the story,
											you have to reexamine
											the facts and motivations
and reputations of your sources
											one more time
											to make sure you
weren&#39;t played or manipulated.
											And if your sources are anonymous,
you better check and double check again.
											It is exhausting,
but after this Sherlock Holmes-ing,
											you usually get the facts that people
need to know to make up their own minds.
											This is Journalism 101,
											how we&#39;re trained in journalism schools
to work in defense of truth.
											Why are even long-trusted
news organizations
											that know how to gather the facts
											vulnerable to attacks
on their credibility?
											Journalism tends to be vulnerable
											because of the enormous power
of credible information.
											When we believe the same story,
											we can find a common purpose
and work together.
											This is what has made humans
an unstoppable force
											throughout our history.
											The historian Yuval Harari suggests
											this is why we are
the only human species to survive
											when once there were at least six
											and why we&#39;ve risen from the middle
of the animal kingdom,
											once huddled around fires
in fear of being eaten,
											to now the top, having the power
to decide what species live or die,
											and how we ourselves
will evolve from here.
											This power to move people is why everyone
wants to control the narrative,
											why truth is fought over
and is the victim,
											usually the first victim,
especially in war.
											It&#39;s why journalists,
as messengers of truth,
											are physically attacked in some parts
of the world and even killed.
											At the same time, unfortunately,
journalism is not like mathematics,
											in which two plus two is always four.
											Journalism is by humans,
about humans and for humans
											and so is inherently
as fallible as humans
											and as vulnerable to criticism.
											Add to that, the job
is to ask prying questions,
											to push past the norms
of good manners for honest answers,
											and then to race to report stories
											that can be controversial,
embarrassing or infuriating.
											If you want to be popular,
don&#39;t be a journalist.
											(Laughter)
											Of course,
											it doesn&#39;t help journalism&#39;s credibility
when it&#39;s under constant attack
											by political leaders in the United States
and around the world.
											(Applause)
											It doesn&#39;t help that emerging technologies
											have eliminated or diminished hundreds
of local newspapers around the country
											and have failed, so far, to replace them
											with anything close to the same quality
and range of credible reporting.
											(Applause)
											But perhaps what is making
journalism most vulnerable
											is that in this industry shift,
some media executives,
											struggling to keep making money
for their corporate owners,
											are pressuring journalists to make choices
that weaken their credibility.
											The pressure for profits is one reason
											we have witnessed the stunning growth
of openly biased news coverage,
											especially on cable television,
											where not everyone who is telling us
the news is actually a journalist.
											Some are advocates with political agendas,
											some are activists,
some are former political operatives,
											and some are what
were once called &quot;opinionaters,&quot;
											people whose profession
is to give their opinions and theories.
											So now I&#39;m the one yelling
at the television set:
											&quot;Just give me the facts!
Stop trying to tell us what to think!&quot;
											(Applause)
											Opinion, thoughtful
and supported with facts,
											has an important place in journalism,
											but it is not news.
											Thus, allowing viewers to think it&#39;s news,
to fail to differentiate it,
											is fundamentally dishonest.
											News is not left or right;
											it&#39;s based on facts
that are either right or wrong.
											(Applause)
											And for the record,
ranting from any point of view
											is not journalism.
											Besides, it has serious side effects:
it makes you look a little nuts.
											(Laughter)
											In the quest for profits,
											corporate owners are punching holes
through the long-standing wall
											protecting journalists
from corporate meddling.
											In some companies, the wall is crumbling.
											I have heard a request from corporate
executives to kill a news story.
											I have seen a media company&#39;s
advertising side
											try to get products placed
in a news broadcast.
											In some companies,
the wall appears to be collapsing.
											Recently, the nation&#39;s
largest broadcaster,
											Sinclair Broadcasting Group,
											which owns and operates
more than 190 stations,
											engaged in corporate manipulation
											when it required dozens of anchors
to read a script the company had provided.
											The push for profits is also pressuring
journalists to muddy their judgment
											with worries about reaching clicks,
ratings and circulation goals.
											This can affect the decisions
they make about what stories to cover,
											what interviews to do and how headlines
and teasers should be written.
											The public is not stupid.
											It can sense these motives
in the work and the hype.
											It knows the truth is in trouble.
											How do we make things right
											and defend our access
to accurate, verifiable reporting,
											which according to
our nation&#39;s Founding Fathers,
											our democracy needs to survive?
											We need a renaissance in journalism.
											(Applause)
											And it is actually possible
that it is already beginning.
											We can see some of our nation&#39;s newspapers
and magazines, in spite of everything,
											leading a rebirth,
											doubling down
											on serious, competitive and groundbreaking
shoe-leather journalism,
											working to tell all the nuances
of the stories they&#39;re covering,
											including both domestic and foreign.
											Our citizens are awakening to the reasons
journalism is vital in a democracy.
											They&#39;re reminded by the movies
&quot;Spotlight&quot; and &quot;The Post,&quot;
											and they&#39;re increasingly demanding
and supporting quality work,
											and in some cases, they are even donating
to the Committee to Protect Journalists.
											And journalists can be seen increasingly
standing up to corporate pressures,
											including at the Denver Post
and at Sinclair TV stations.
											They&#39;re also pushing across platforms
to do smarter and more impactful reporting
											and balanced stories.
											And in some newsrooms, editors
are reviving investigative reporting.
											(Applause)
											Credibility lost is never fully regained.
											But what survives can be protected,
											and new bridges can be built
by the journalists still to come.
											For that to happen,
											for news organizations to better endure
attacks on their credibility,
											journalists must be able to work
with one motive: the public good.
											Corporate owners and executives
must know how to stay in their lane
											and out of influencing
what and how stories are covered.
											Investors and advertisers
will need to stop pressuring journalists
											to be their pot of gold
and do what&#39;s right for this country:
											fund excellence and get out of the way.
											Editors and executive producers
will have to fight harder
											against the blurring
between opinion and news
											until all the stories we need to know,
											not just the ones or the one
that might increase ratings and clicks.
											(Applause)
											Technologists should realize
they are not journalists;
											they are platform creators and owners

											and should hire solid reporters
and then leave them alone
											and make those reporters
great forces for good.
											(Applause)
											And news consumers,
if you want the facts, subscribe.
											(Applause)
											Read newspapers
											and perhaps ask,
											Why would journalism
that&#39;s any good be free?
											(Applause)
											Why do any one of us
											routinely put up with baseless opinion,
speculation and propaganda?
											And why do we waste so much time
on the Kardashians?
											(Laughter)
											(Cheers) (Applause)
											Too much sugar just makes you fat.
											(Laughter)
											Journalists, keep going and stay humble.
											We may know a little about a lot,
											but few of us know enough about anything
to have an opinion that matters.
											So we dig for the facts
that do matter, from all sides,
											and then fight like hell to tell them.
											And potential future journalists,
											your country needs you.
											Journalism is war,
a fight every day for truth.
											And it takes more than being curious
											and knowing how to write or blog
or shoot a video or ask questions.
											It takes courage, and most of all,
it takes integrity.
											Because journalism is only as good
as the people who practice it
											and their willingness
to stand up and fight
											for the stories that mean something.
											You will make mistakes; we all do.
											But with practice and instincts
you may not know you have,
											you will learn to make less of them.
											You will face a lack of resources,
											you will be denied access,
											people will refuse to give you interviews,
											editors and executive producers
will give you impossible deadlines
											and not enough time or space
to tell your stories.
											This is emotionally hard
and sometimes around-the-clock work.
											It might cause people to hate you.
											It might put you in danger
											or expose you to trauma
that might give you PTSD.
											This I know from experience.
											But after nearly 40 years at this,
											I still stand here before you
											and can honestly say with all my heart:
											journalism is a noble calling,
a way to serve people
											and respond like an EMT
or an emergency room doctor in a crisis
											with information they may need.
											If you work for the people
and not for those who pay your checks,
											you will make the right choices
about who to interview,
											what to ask and how to tell your stories,
											and this will bring
your news organizations value
											that will make even your bosses happy.
											Be incorruptible.
											Do it with a pure motive, earnestly,
without bias and expectations.
											Do it even though you may never know
the impact of your stories.
											Do it even if you know
you will be criticized.
											But get it right,
											which you will find is far more important
											than getting it first.
											Attribute,
											(Applause)
											attribute whenever possible.
											Check, check, and then
double check the facts.
											Ruthlessly edit out any word
or phrase or tone in your work
											that could get in the way
of people making up their own minds.
											This is how we build trust,
											by working to be worthy of it.
											It is time to lift truth off its knees,
											prize it, cherish it, defend it
											and watch it rise along with all of us.
											Thank you.
											(Applause) (Cheers)
