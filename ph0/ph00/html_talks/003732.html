											We live on a human-dominated planet,
											putting unprecedented pressure
											on the systems on Earth.
											This is bad news, but perhaps surprising to you,
											it&#39;s also part of the good news.
											We&#39;re the first generation — thanks to science —
											to be informed that we may be
											undermining the stability and the ability
											of planet Earth
											to support human development as we know it.
											It&#39;s also good news, because the planetary risks we&#39;re facing
											are so large,
											that business as usual is not an option.
											In fact, we&#39;re in a phase
											where transformative change is necessary,
											which opens the window for innovation,
											for new ideas and new paradigms.
											This is a scientific journey on the challenges facing humanity
											in the global phase of sustainability.

											On this journey, I&#39;d like to bring, apart from yourselves,
											a good friend,
											a stakeholder, who&#39;s always absent
											when we deal with the negotiations on environmental issues,
											a stakeholder who refuses to compromise —
											planet Earth.
											So I thought I&#39;d bring her with me today on stage,
											to have her as a witness
											of a remarkable journey,
											which humbly reminds us
											of the period of grace we&#39;ve had
											over the past 10,000 years.
											This is the living conditions on the planet over the last 100,000 years.
											It&#39;s a very important period —
											it&#39;s roughly half the period when we&#39;ve been fully modern humans on the planet.
											We&#39;ve had the same, roughly, abilities
											that developed civilizations as we know it.

											Here, used as a proxy, temperature variability.
											It was a jumpy ride. 80,000 years back in a crisis,
											we leave Africa, we colonize Australia
											in another crisis, 60,000 years back,
											we leave Asia for Europe
											in another crisis, 40,000 years back,
											and then we enter
											the remarkably stable Holocene phase,
											the only period in the whole history of the planet,
											that we know of, that can support human development.
											A thousand years into this period,
											we abandon our hunting and gathering patterns.
											We go from a couple of million people
											to the seven billion people we are today.
											The Mesopotamian culture: we invent agriculture,

											The trouble is we&#39;re putting a quadruple sqeeze
											on this poor planet,
											a quadruple sqeeze, which, as its first squeeze,
											has population growth of course.
											Now, this is not only about numbers;
											this is not only about the fact that we&#39;re seven billion people
											committed to nine billion people, it&#39;s an equity issue as well.
											The majority of the environmental impacts on the planet
											have been caused by the rich minority,
											the 20 percent that jumped onto the industrial bandwagon
											in the mid-18th century.
											The majority of the planet,
											aspiring for development, having the right for development,

											The second pressure on the planet is, of course the climate agenda —
											the big issue — where the policy interpretation of science
											is that it would be enough
											to stabilize greenhouse gases at 450 ppm
											to avoid average temperatures
											exceeding two degrees,
											to avoid the risk that we may be destabilizing
											the West Antarctic Ice Sheet,
											holding six meters — level rising,
											the risk of destabilizing the Greenland Ice Sheet,
											holding another seven meters — sea level rising.
											Now, you would have wished the climate pressure
											to hit a strong planet, a resilient planet,
											but unfortunately, the third pressure
											is the ecosystem decline.
											Never have we seen, in the past 50 years,
											such a sharp decline
											of ecosystem functions and services on the planet,
											one of them being the ability to regulate climate on the long term,
											in our forests, land and biodiversity.

											The forth pressure is surprise,
											the notion and the evidence
											that we need to abandon our old paradigm,
											that ecosystems behave linearly, predictably,
											controllably in our — so to say — linear systems,
											and that in fact, surprise is universal,
											as systems tip over very rapidly, abruptly
											and often irreversibly.
											This, dear friends, poses a human pressure on the planet
											of momentous scale.
											We may, in fact, have entered a new geological era —
											the Anthropocene,
											where humans are the predominant driver of change
											at a planetary level.

									<p>
											Now, as a scientist,
											what&#39;s the evidence for this?
											Well, the evidence is,
											unfortunately, ample.
											It&#39;s not only carbon dioxide
											that has this hockey stick pattern of accelerated change.
											You can take virtually any parameter
											that matters for human well-being —
											nitrous oxide, methane,
											deforestation, overfishing
											land degredation, loss of species —
											they all show the same pattern
											over the past 200 years.
											Simultaneously, they branch off in the mid-50s,
											10 years after the Second World War,
											showing very clearly that the great acceleration of the human enterprise
											starts in the mid-50s.
											You see, for the first time, an imprint on the global level.
											And I can tell you,
											you enter the disciplinary research in each of these,
											you find something remarkably important,
											the conclusion that we may have come to the point
											where we have to bend the curves,
											that we may have entered the most challenging and exciting decade
											in the history humanity on the planet,
											the decade when we have to bend the curves.

									<p>
											Now, as if this was not enough —
											to just bend the curves and understanding the accelerated pressure on the planet —
											we also have to recognize the fact
											that systems do have multiple stable states,
											separated by thresholds — illustrated here by this ball and cup diagram,
											where the depth of the cup is the resilience of the system.
											Now, the system may gradually —
											under pressure of climate change,
											erosion, biodiversity loss —
											lose the depth of the cup, the resilience,
											but appear to be healthy
											and appear to suddenly, under a threshold,
											be tipping over. Upff.
											Sorry. Changing state
											and literally ending up
											in an undesired situation,
											where new biophysical logic takes over,
											new species take over, and the system gets locked.

									<p>
											Do we have evidence of this? Yes, coral reef systems.
											Biodiverse, low-nutrient, hard coral systems
											under multiple pressures of overfishing,
											unsustainable tourism, climate change.
											A trigger and the system tips over,
											loses its resilience,
											soft corals take over,
											and we get undesired systems
											that cannot support economic and social development.
											The Arctic — a beautiful system —
											a regulating biome at the planetary level,
											taking the knock after knock on climate change,
											appearing to be in a good state.
											No scientist could predict that in 2007,
											suddenly, what could be crossing a threshold.
											The system suddenly, very surprisingly, loses 30 to 40 percent
											of its summer ice cover.
											And the drama is, of course, that
											when the system does this, the logic may change.
											It may get locked in an undesired state,
											because it changes color, absorbs more energy,
											and the system may get stuck.
											In my mind, the largest red flag warning for humanity
											that we are in a precarious situation.
											As a sideline, you know that the only red flag that popped up here
											was a submarine from an unnamed country
											that planted a red flag at the bottom of the Arctic
											to be able to control the oil resources.

											Now, if we have evidence, which we now have,
											that wetlands, forests,
											[unclear] monsoon system, the rainforests,
											behave in this nonlinear way.
											30 or so scientists around the world
											gathered and asked a question for the first time,
											&quot;Do we have to put the planet into the the pot?&quot;
											So we have to ask ourselves:
											are we threatening this extraordinarily stable Holocene state?
											Are we in fact putting ourselves in a situation
											where we&#39;re coming too close
											to thresholds that could lead
											to deleterious and very undesired,
											if now catastrophic, change
											for human development?
											You know, you don&#39;t want to stand there.
											In fact, you&#39;re not even allowed to stand
											where this gentleman is standing,
											at the foaming, slippery waters at the threshold.
											In fact, there&#39;s a fence
											quite upstream of this threshold,
											beyond which you are in a danger zone.
											And this is the new paradigm,
											which we gathered two, three years back,
											recognizing that our old paradigm
											of just analyzing and pushing and predicting
											parameters into the future,
											aiming at minimalizing environmental impacts, is of the past.

											Now we to ask ourselves:
											which are the large environmental processes
											that we have to be stewards of
											to keep ourselves safe in the Holocene?
											And could we even,
											thanks to major advancements in Earth systems science,
											identify the thresholds,
											the points where we may expect nonlinear change?
											And could we even define
											a planetary boundary, a fence,
											within which we then have a safe operating space for humanity?
											This work, which was published in &quot;Nature,&quot;
											late 2009,
											after a number of years of analysis,
											led to the final proposition
											that we can only find
											nine planetary boundaries
											with which, under active stewardship,
											would allow ourselves to have a safe operating space.
											These include, of course, climate.
											It may surprise you that it&#39;s not only climate.
											But it shows that we are interconnected, among many systems on the planet,
											with the three big systems, climate change,
											stratospheric ozone depletion and ocean acidification
											being the three big systems,
											where the scientific evidence of large-scale thresholds
											in the paleo-record of the history of the planet.

											But we also include, what we call, the slow variables,
											the systems that, under the hood,
											regulate and buffer the capacity of the resilience of the planet —
											the interference of the big nitrogen and phosphorus cycles on the planet,
											land use change, rate of biodiversity loss,
											freshwater use,
											functions which regulate
											biomass on the planet, carbon sequestration, diversity.
											And then we have two parameters which we were not able to quantify —
											air pollution,
											including warming gases and air-polluting sulfates and nitrates,
											but also chemical pollution.
											Together, these form an integrated whole
											for guiding human development in the Anthropocene,
											understanding that the planet
											is a complex self-regulating system.
											In fact, most evidence indicates
											that these nine may behave as three Musketeers,
											&quot;One for all. All for one.&quot;
											You degrade forests, you go beyond the boundary on land,
											you undermine the ability of the climate system
											to stay stable.
											The drama here is, in fact, that
											it may show that the climate challenge

											Now this is the Big Bang equivalent then of human development
											within the safe operating space of the planetary boundaries.
											What you see here in black line is the safe operating space,
											the quantified boundaries,
											as suggested by this analysis.
											The yellow dot in the middle here is our starting point,
											the pre-industrial point,
											where we&#39;re very safely in the safe operating space.
											In the &#39;50s, we start branching out.
											In the &#39;60s already, through the green revolution
											and the Haber-Bosch process
											of fixing nitrogen from the atmosphere —
											you know, human&#39;s today take out more nitrogen from the atmosphere
											than the whole biosphere does naturally as a whole.
											We don&#39;t transgress the climate boundary until the early &#39;90s,
											actually, right after Rio.
											And today, we are in a situation where we estimate
											that we&#39;ve transgressed three boundaries,
											the rate of biodiversity loss,
											which is the sixth extinction period in the history of humanity —
											one of them being the extinctions of the dinosaurs —
											nitrogen and climate change.
											But we still have some degrees of freedom on the others,
											but we are approaching fast
											on land, water, phosphorus and oceans.

											Now the question then is:
											how gloomy is this?

											Well, there&#39;s no science to suggest.
											In fact, there is ample science
											to indicate that we can do this transformative change,
											that we have the ability
											to now move into a new innovative,
											a transformative gear,
											across scales.
											The drama is, of course,
											is that 200 countries on this planet
											have to simultaneously start moving
											in the same direction.
											But it changes fundamentally our governance and management paradigm,
											from the current linear,
											command and control thinking,

											towards a much more flexible,
											a much more adaptive approach,
											where we recognize that redundancy,
											both in social and environmental systems,
											is key to be able to deal
											with a turbulent era of global change.
											We have to invest in persistence,
											in the ability of social systems and ecological systems
											to withstand shocks and still remain in that desired cup.
											We have to invest in transformations capability,
											moving from crisis into innovation
											and the ability to rise after a crisis,
											and of course to adapt to unavoidable change.
											This is a new paradigm.

											But is it happening anywhere?
											Do we have any examples of success

											There&#39;s good news here,
											for example, from Latin America,

											among farmers in partnership with scientists
											into an agricultural revolution of zero tillage systems
											combined with mulch farming
											with locally adapted technologies,
											which today, for example, in some countries,
											have led to a tremendous increase
											in area under mulch, zero till farming
