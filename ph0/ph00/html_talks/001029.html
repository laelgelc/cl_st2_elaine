<title>Gwynne Shotwell: SpaceX&#39;s plan to fly you across the globe in 30 minutes | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: What&#39;s up at SpaceX? Engineer Gwynne Shotwell was employee number seven at Elon Musk&#39;s pioneering aerospace company and is now its president. In conversation with TED curator Chris Anderson, she discusses SpaceX&#39;s race to put people into orbit and the organization&#39;s next big project, the BFR (ask her what it stands for). The new giant rocket is designed to take humanity to Mars -- but it has another potential use: space travel for earthlings." />

In conversation with TED curator Chris Anderson, she discusses SpaceX's race to put people into orbit and the organization's next big project, the BFR (ask her what it stands for).

for Dragon is pretty unique.
											It&#39;s an integrated launch escape system.
											It&#39;s basically a pusher,
											so the propellant system and the thrusters
are integrated into the capsule,
											and so if it detects a rocket problem,
it pushes the capsule away.
											Capsule safety systems in the past
have been like tractor pullers,

you can safely reenter that capsule,

on the shoulders of giants. Right?
											We got to look at the rocket industry

that we had to include
											in our vehicle systems.

around legacy components

											GS: There&#39;s hundreds of examples,
actually, of that,
											but basically, we got to construct
the vehicle design
											from, really, a clean sheet of paper,
											and we got to make decisions
that we wanted to make.
											The tank architecture —
it&#39;s a common dome design.
											Basically it&#39;s like two beer cans
stacked together,
											one full of liquid oxygen,
											one full of RP,
											and that basically saved weight.
											It allowed us to basically take
more payload for the same design.
											One of the other elements of the vehicle
that we&#39;re flying right now
											is we do use densified
liquid oxygen and densified RP,
											so it&#39;s ultracold,
											and it allows you to pack
more propellent into the vehicle.
											It is done elsewhere,
											probably not to the degree that we do it,

of margin to the vehicle,

&quot;Well, that&#39;s impossible,&quot;
											or, &quot;There&#39;s no way we&#39;re going

substantially harder.

was to take these ideas

make them achievable,

I felt like we were there,
											we were rolling over,
people were getting comfortable,
											Elon would throw something out there,

											is that we&#39;re going to actually land
on the pad that we launched from.
											Currently, we land on a separate pad,
or we land out on a boat.
											Fast, quick connect.
											You take a cargo ship full of fuel,
											or a fuel depot,
											put it on that booster, get that in orbit,
											do a docking maneuver,
refuel the spaceship,
											and head on to your destination,
											and this one is Mars.

											It&#39;s the fundamental risk reduction
for the human species.
											And this does not subvert
											making our planet here better
and doing a better job taking care of it,
											but I think you need
multiple paths to survival,

											And let&#39;s not talk about the downer piece,
											like, you go to Mars to make sure
all earthlings don&#39;t die.
											That&#39;s terrible, actually,
that&#39;s a terrible reason to go do it.
											Fundamentally,
it&#39;s another place to explore,

different from animals,
											it&#39;s our sense of exploration
and sense of wonderment

											And then I also have to say,
											this is the first step
in us moving to other solar systems

I ever out-vision Elon,

He spent his early years in India, Pakistan and Afghanistan, where his parents worked as medical missionaries, and he attended an American school in the Himalayas for his early education. After boarding school in Bath, England, he went on to Oxford University, graduating in 1978 with a degree in philosophy, politics and economics.</p><p class=\"p1\">Chris then trained as a journalist, working in newspapers and radio, including two years producing a world news service in the Seychelles Islands.</p><p class=\"p1\"> Back in the UK in 1984, Chris was captivated by the personal computer revolution and became an editor at one of the UK&#39;s early computer magazines. A year later he founded Future Publishing with a $25,000 bank loan. The new company initially focused on specialist computer publications but eventually expanded into other areas such as cycling, music, video games, technology and design, doubling in size every year for seven years. In 1994, Chris moved to the United States where he built Imagine Media, publisher of <em>Business 2.0</em> magazine and creator of the popular video game users website IGN. Chris eventually merged Imagine and Future, taking the combined entity public in London in 1999, under the Future name. At its peak, it published 150 magazines and websites and employed 2,000 people.</p><p class=\"p1\">This success allowed Chris to create a private nonprofit organization, the Sapling Foundation, with the hope of finding new ways to tackle tough global issues through media, technology, entrepreneurship and, most of all, ideas. In 2001, the foundation acquired the TED Conference, then an annual meeting of luminaries in the fields of Technology, Entertainment and Design held in Monterey, California, and Chris left Future to work full time on TED.</p><p class=\"p1\">He expanded the conference&#39;s remit to cover all topics, including science, business and key global issues, while adding a Fellows program, which now has some 300 alumni, and the TED Prize, which grants its recipients &quot;one wish to change the world.&quot; The TED stage has become a place for thinkers and doers from all fields to share their ideas and their work, capturing imaginations, sparking conversation and encouraging discovery along the way.</p><p class=\"p1\">In 2006, TED experimented with posting some of its talks on the Internet. Their viral success encouraged Chris to begin positioning the organization as a global media initiative devoted to &#39;ideas worth spreading,&#39; part of a new era of information dissemination using the power of online video. In June 2015, the organization posted its 2,000th talk online. The talks are free to view, and they have been translated into more than 100 languages with the help of volunteers from around the world. Viewership has grown to approximately one billion views per year.</p><p class=\"p1\">Continuing a strategy of &#39;radical openness,&#39; in 2009 Chris introduced the TEDx initiative, allowing free licenses to local organizers who wished to organize their own TED-like events. More than 8,000 such events have been held, generating an archive of 60,000 TEDx talks. And three years later, the TED-Ed program was launched, offering free educational videos and tools to students and teachers.</p>"}],"url":"https://www.ted.com/talks/gwynne_shotwell_spacex_s_plan_to_fly_you_across_the_globe_in_30_minutes","viewed_count":2605636,"talks":[{"recommendations":null,"more_resources":[],"corrections":[],"has_citations":true,"take_action":[],"explore_cta_experiment":{},"curator_approved":true,"description":"What's up at SpaceX?

He spent his early years in India, Pakistan and Afghanistan, where his parents worked as medical missionaries, and he attended an American school in the Himalayas for his early education. After boarding school in Bath, England, he went on to Oxford University, graduating in 1978 with a degree in philosophy, politics and economics.</p><p class=\"p1\">Chris then trained as a journalist, working in newspapers and radio, including two years producing a world news service in the Seychelles Islands.</p><p class=\"p1\"> Back in the UK in 1984, Chris was captivated by the personal computer revolution and became an editor at one of the UK&#39;s early computer magazines. A year later he founded Future Publishing with a $25,000 bank loan. The new company initially focused on specialist computer publications but eventually expanded into other areas such as cycling, music, video games, technology and design, doubling in size every year for seven years. In 1994, Chris moved to the United States where he built Imagine Media, publisher of <em>Business 2.0</em> magazine and creator of the popular video game users website IGN. Chris eventually merged Imagine and Future, taking the combined entity public in London in 1999, under the Future name. At its peak, it published 150 magazines and websites and employed 2,000 people.</p><p class=\"p1\">This success allowed Chris to create a private nonprofit organization, the Sapling Foundation, with the hope of finding new ways to tackle tough global issues through media, technology, entrepreneurship and, most of all, ideas. In 2001, the foundation acquired the TED Conference, then an annual meeting of luminaries in the fields of Technology, Entertainment and Design held in Monterey, California, and Chris left Future to work full time on TED.</p><p class=\"p1\">He expanded the conference&#39;s remit to cover all topics, including science, business and key global issues, while adding a Fellows program, which now has some 300 alumni, and the TED Prize, which grants its recipients &quot;one wish to change the world.&quot; The TED stage has become a place for thinkers and doers from all fields to share their ideas and their work, capturing imaginations, sparking conversation and encouraging discovery along the way.</p><p class=\"p1\">In 2006, TED experimented with posting some of its talks on the Internet. Their viral success encouraged Chris to begin positioning the organization as a global media initiative devoted to &#39;ideas worth spreading,&#39; part of a new era of information dissemination using the power of online video. In June 2015, the organization posted its 2,000th talk online. The talks are free to view, and they have been translated into more than 100 languages with the help of volunteers from around the world. Viewership has grown to approximately one billion views per year.</p><p class=\"p1\">Continuing a strategy of &#39;radical openness,&#39; in 2009 Chris introduced the TEDx initiative, allowing free licenses to local organizers who wished to organize their own TED-like events. More than 8,000 such events have been held, generating an archive of 60,000 TEDx talks. And three years later, the TED-Ed program was launched, offering free educational videos and tools to students and teachers.</p>"}],"speaker_name":"Gwynne Shotwell","tags":["adventure","business","cosmos","curiosity","engineering","entrepreneur","extraterrestrial life","future","exploration","humanity","innovation","leadership","rocket science","space","science","universe"],"title":"SpaceX's plan to fly you across the globe in 30 minutes","video_type":{"id":"1","name":"TED Stage Talk"},"viewed_count":2605636}]}})</script></div>
