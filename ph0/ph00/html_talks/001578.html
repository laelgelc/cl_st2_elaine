Language evolves over time, and with it the way we spell — is it worth it to spend so much time memorizing rules that are filled with endless exceptions?

											We lost a lot of time at school
learning spelling.
											Kids are still losing a lot of time
at school with spelling.
											That&#39;s why I want to share
a question with you:
											Do we need new spelling rules?
											I believe that yes, we do.
											Or even better, I think we need
to simplify the ones we already have.

											Neither the question nor the answer
are new in the Spanish language.
											They have been bouncing around
from century to century
											since 1492, when in the first grammar
guide of the Spanish language,
											Antonio de Nebrija, set a clear and simple
principle for our spelling:
											&quot;... thus, we have to write words
as we pronounce them,
											and pronounce words as we write them.&quot;
											Each sound was to correspond
to one letter,
											each letter was to represent
a single sound,
											and those which did not represent
any sound should be removed.
											This approach, the phonetic approach,
											which says we have to write
words as we pronounce them,
											both is and isn&#39;t at the root of spelling
as we practice it today.
											It is, because the Spanish language,
in contrast to English, French or others,
											always strongly resisted
writing words too differently
											to how we pronounce them.

								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											But the phonetic approach
is also absent today,
											because when, in the 18th century,
we decided how we would standardize
											our writing,
											there was another approach which guided
a good part of the decisions.
											It was the etymological approach,
											the one that says we have to write words
											according to how they were written
in their original language,
											in Latin, in Greek.
											That&#39;s how we ended up with silent H&#39;s,
which we write but don&#39;t pronounce.
											That&#39;s how we have B&#39;s and V&#39;s that,
contrary to what many people believe,
											were never differentiated
in Spanish pronunciation.
											That&#39;s how we wound up with G&#39;s,
											that are sometimes aspirated,
as in &quot;gente,&quot;
											and other times unaspirated, as in &quot;gato.&quot;
											That&#39;s how we ended up
with C&#39;s, S&#39;s and Z&#39;s,
											three letters that in some places
correspond to one sound,
											and in others, to two,
but nowhere to three.

											I&#39;m not here to tell you anything
you don&#39;t know from your own experience.
											We all went to school,
											we all invested big amounts
of learning time,
											big amounts of pliant,
childlike brain time
											in dictation,
											in the memorization of spelling rules
filled, nevertheless, with exceptions.
											We were told in many ways,
implicitly and explicitly,
											that in spelling, something fundamental
to our upbringing was at stake.
											Yet, I have the feeling
											that teachers didn&#39;t ask themselves
why it was so important.
											In fact, they didn&#39;t ask themselves
a previous question:
											What is the purpose of spelling?
											What do we need spelling for?

									<p>
											And the truth is, when someone
asks themselves this question,
											the answer is much simpler
and less momentous
											than we&#39;d usually believe.
											We use spelling to unify the way we write,
so we can all write the same way,
											making it easier for us to understand
when we read to each other.
											But unlike in other aspects of language
such as punctuation,
											in spelling, there&#39;s no
individual expression involved.
											In punctuation, there is.
											With punctuation, I can choose
to change the meaning of a phrase.
											With punctuation, I can impose
a particular rhythm to what I am writing,
											but not with spelling.
											When it comes to spelling,
it&#39;s either wrong or right,
											according to whether it conforms
or not to the current rules.
											But then, wouldn&#39;t it be more sensible
to simplify the current rules
											so it would be easier to teach, learn
and use spelling correctly?
											Wouldn&#39;t it be more sensible
to simplify the current rules
											so that all the time we devote today
to teaching spelling,
											we could devote to other language issues
											whose complexities do, in fact,
deserve the time and effort?

											What I propose is not to abolish spelling,
											and have everyone write however they want.
											Language is a tool of common usage,
											and so I believe it&#39;s fundamental
that we use it following common criteria.
											But I also find it fundamental
											that those common criteria
be as simple as possible,
											especially because
if we simplify our spelling,
											we&#39;re not leveling it down;
											when spelling is simplified,
											the quality of the language
doesn&#39;t suffer at all.

											I work every day with Spanish
Golden Age literature,
											I read Garcilaso, Cervantes,
Góngora, Quevedo,
											who sometimes write &quot;hombre&quot; without H,
											sometimes write &quot;escribir&quot; with V,
											and it&#39;s absolutely clear to me
											that the difference between those texts
and ours is one of convention,
											or rather, a lack of convention
during their time.
											But it&#39;s not a difference of quality.
											But let me go back to the masters,
											because they&#39;re key characters
in this story.
											Earlier, I mentioned this slightly
thoughtless insistence
											with which teachers pester and pester us
											over spelling.
											But the truth is,
things being as they are,
											this makes perfect sense.
											In our society, spelling serves
as an index of privilege,
											separating the cultured from the brute,
the educated from the ignorant,
											independent of the content
that&#39;s being written.
											One can get or not get a job
											because of an H that one put or did not.
											One can become
an object of public ridicule
											because of a misplaced B.
											Therefore, in this context,
											of course, it makes sense to dedicate
all this time to spelling.

											But we shouldn&#39;t forget
											that throughout the history
of our language,
											it has always been teachers
											or people involved
in the early learning of language
											who promoted spelling reforms,
											who realized that in our spelling
there was often an obstacle
											to the transmission of knowledge.
											In our case, for example,
											Sarmiento, together with Andrés Bello,
spearheaded the biggest spelling reform
											to take place in the Spanish language:
											the mid-19th century Chilean reform.
											Then, why not take over
the task of those teachers
											and start making progress in our spelling?
											Here, in this intimate group of 10,000,
											I&#39;d like to bring to the table
											some changes that I find reasonable
to start discussing.

											Let&#39;s choose one; it could be either.
We can discuss it, talk it over.
											Everyone will have their preferences
and can make their arguments.
											Let&#39;s keep one, remove the other.
											G and J, let&#39;s separate their roles.
											G should keep the unaspirated sound,
like in &quot;gato,&quot; &quot;mago,&quot; and &quot;águila,&quot;
											and J should keep the aspirated sound,
											as in &quot;jarabe,&quot; &quot;jirafa,&quot;
&quot;gente,&quot; &quot;argentino.&quot;
											The case of C, S and Z is interesting,
											because it shows that the phonetic
approach must be a guide,
											but it can&#39;t be an absolute principle.
											In some cases, the differences
in pronunciation must be addressed.
											As I said before, C, S and Z,
											in some places, correspond
to one sound, in others to two.
											If we go from three letters
to two, we&#39;re all better off.

											To some, these changes
may seem a bit drastic.
											They&#39;re really not.
											The Royal Spanish Academy,
all of language academies,
											also believes that spelling
should be progressively modified;
											that language is linked to history,
tradition and custom,
											but that at the same time,
it is a practical everyday tool
											and that sometimes this attachment
to history, tradition and custom
											becomes an obstacle for its current usage.
											Indeed, this explains the fact
											that our language, much more than
the others we are geographically close to,
											has been historically
modifying itself based on us,
											for example, we went
from &quot;ortographia&quot; to &quot;ortografía,&quot;
											from &quot;theatro&quot; to &quot;teatro,&quot;
from &quot;quantidad&quot; to &quot;cantidad,&quot;
											from &quot;symbolo&quot; to &quot;símbolo.&quot;
											And some silent H&#39;s are slowly
being stealthily removed:
											in the Dictionary of the Royal Academy,
											&quot;arpa&quot; and &quot;armonía&quot; can be written
with or without an H.
											And everybody is OK.

									<p>
											I also believe
											that this is a particularly appropriate
moment to have this discussion.
											It&#39;s always said that language
changes spontaneously,
											from the bottom up,
											that its users are the ones
who incorporate new words
											and who introduce grammatical changes,
											and that the authority —
in some places an academy,
											in others a dictionary,
in others a ministry —
											accepts and incorporates them
long after the fact.
											This is true only
for some levels of language.
											It is true on the lexical level,
the level of words.
											It is less true on the grammatical level,
											and I would almost say
it is not true for the spelling level,
											that has historically changed
from the top down.
											Institutions have always been the ones
to establish the rules
											and propose changes.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Why do I say this is a particularly
appropriate moment?
											Until today,
											writing always had a much more restricted
and private use than speech.
											But in our time,
the age of social networks,
											this is going through
a revolutionary change.
											Never before have people written so much;
											never before have people written
for so many others to see.
											And in these social networks,
for the first time,
											we&#39;re seeing innovative uses
of spelling on a large scale,
											where even more-than-educated people
with impeccable spelling,
											when using social networks,
											behave a lot like the majority of users
of social networks behave.
											That is to say, they slack
on spell-checking
											and prioritize speed and efficacy
in communication.
											For now, on social networks,
we see chaotic, individual usages.
											But I think we have
to pay attention to them,
											because they&#39;re probably telling us
											that an era that designates
a new place for writing
											seeks new criteria for that writing.
											I think we&#39;d be wrong
to reject them, to discard them,
											because we identify them as symptoms
of the cultural decay of our times.
											No, I believe we have to observe them,
organize them and channel them
											within guidelines that better correspond
to the needs of our times.

											I can anticipate some objections.
											There will be those who&#39;ll say
											that if we simplify spelling
we&#39;ll lose etymology.
											Strictly speaking, if we wanted
to preserve etymology,
											it would go beyond just spelling.
											We&#39;d also have to learn
Latin, Greek, Arabic.
											With simplified spelling,
											we would normalize etymology
in the same place we do now:
											in etymological dictionaries.
											A second objection will come
from those who say:
											&quot;If we simplify spelling,
we&#39;ll stop distinguishing
											between words that differ
in just one letter.&quot;
											That is true, but it&#39;s not a problem.
											Our language has homonyms,
words with more than one meaning,
											yet we don&#39;t confuse
the &quot;banco&quot; where we sit
											with the &quot;banco&quot; where we deposit money,
											or the &quot;traje&quot; that we wear
with the things we &quot;trajimos.&quot;
											In the vast majority of situations,
context dispels any confusion.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											But there&#39;s a third objection.
											To me,
											it&#39;s the most understandable,
even the most moving.
											It&#39;s the people who&#39;ll say:
&quot;I don&#39;t want to change.
											I was brought up like this,
I got used to doing it this way,
											when I read a written word
in simplified spelling, my eyes hurt.&quot;

											This objection is, in part, in all of us.
											What do I think we should do?
											The same thing that&#39;s always
done in these cases:
											changes are made looking forward;
children are taught the new rules,
											those of us who don&#39;t want to adapt
can write the way we&#39;re used to writing,
											and hopefully, time will cement
the new rules in place.
											The success of every spelling reform
that affects deeply rooted habits
											lies in caution, agreement,
gradualism and tolerance.
											At the same time, can&#39;t allow
the attachment to old customs
											impede us from moving forward.
											The best tribute we can pay to the past
											is to improve upon what it&#39;s given us.

											So I believe that we must
reach an agreement,
											that academies must reach an agreement,
											and purge from our spelling rules
											all the habits we practice
just for the sake of tradition,
											even if they are useless now.
											I&#39;m convinced that if we do that
											in the humble but extremely
important realm of language,
											we&#39;ll be leaving a better future
to the next generations.

In my view, this Handbook ranks among the most solid, didactic and erudite allegations in favor of spelling simplification. It exposes the \"many anomalies\" of English spelling, and it carefully recounts its history (full of mistakes and misunderstandings) together with the history of spelling reformers. It also makes the case for reform, responds one by one to possible objections and recommends new spelling rules as well a list of words to be spelled differently.\r\n\r\nLet me add that Brander Matthews, a member of the Board, was also Theodore Roosevelt's personal friend. In 1906, he convinced the then President to issue a Presidential edict to simplify the spelling of 300 English words in official texts.

Roosevelt, however, continued to use some of the simplified words in his private correspondence.","note":"Henry Gallup Paine\r\nSimplified Spelling Board, 1920","link_url":"https://archive.org/details/handbookofsimpli00simprich","position":null,"is_pdf":false,"eyebrow":null},{"label":"READ_Article","headline":"“Indicaciones sobre la conveniencia de simplificar y uniformar la ortografía en América\"","blurb":"This text, as well as the following two, relate to the most important spelling reform in the Spanish language, the one that took place in Chile between 1844 and 1927. This article, first published in 1823 by the intellectual father of the Chilean reform, outlines Andrés Bello’s basic ideas on how Spanish spelling should be simplified in order \"to facilitate and spread the art of reading\" in the newly born Spanish American countries. His proposal, however, was not solely Latin American. Similar claims were also being made at the time in Spain. And, by and large, they still speak to us.\r\n\r\nAvailable in English as \"Notes on the Advisability of Simplifying and Standardizing Orthography in America\" in Selected Writings of Andés Bello.

Obras completas.\"","blurb":"Domingo Faustino Sarmiento – a self-taught educator who would later become one of the finest writers of 19th Century Spanish America as well as Argentine president - was a master of verbal pugilism. He thrived in controversy. Perhaps that is why he was appointed to promote the Chilean spelling reform. This text is the one he read in 1843 in front of a tough audience: the Faculty of the Humanities of the University of Chile. He defended his ideas, more radical than Bello’s, with his usual vehemence and clarity, without depriving himself of the pleasure of insulting his own public. As he said, he wished he was not addressing “grammarians and Latinists, preoccupied with a sterile science”, but youngsters, women, men of commerce and the like who were looked down upon by the litterati \"because they do not possess the secret of placing a few letters correctly.\" Maybe not the wisest choice.

Rather than an account of Bello’s ideas, it is a comprehensive survey of the history of Spanish spelling, a history animated -- in his words -- by \"an impulse for spelling reform that encompassed the whole Spanish tradition from Nebrija on.\" Rosenblat paints a lively portrait of spelling as a battlefield where different ideas, criteria, individuals and institutions dialogue and confront throughout time. The most endearing lesson one draws from this article is that the written language is not something we are given in stone. It is the product of a history of changes and it is still susceptible of revision.","note":"Ángel Rosenblat\r\nPrologue to Andrés Bello, Obras Completas.\r\nVolume V.
