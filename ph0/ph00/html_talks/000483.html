											When you think about resilience and technology it&#39;s actually much easier.
											You&#39;re going to see some other speakers today, I already know,
											who are going to talk about breaking-bones stuff,
											and, of course, with technology it never is.
											So it&#39;s very easy, comparatively speaking, to be resilient.
											I think that, if we look at what happened on the Internet,
											with such an incredible last half a dozen years,
											that it&#39;s hard to even get the right analogy for it.
											A lot of how we decide, how we&#39;re supposed to react to things
											and what we&#39;re supposed to expect about the future
											depends on how we bucket things
											and how we categorize them.

											And so I think the tempting analogy for the boom-bust
											that we just went through with the Internet is a gold rush.
											It&#39;s easy to think of this analogy as very different
											from some of the other things you might pick.
											For one thing, both were very real.
											In 1849, in that Gold Rush, they took over $700 million
											worth of gold out of California. It was very real.
											The Internet was also very real. This is a real way for humans to
											communicate with each other. It&#39;s a big deal.
											Huge boom. Huge boom. Huge bust. Huge bust.
											You keep going, and both things are lots of hype.
											I don&#39;t have to remind you of all the hype
											that was involved with the Internet — like GetRich.com.

											But you had the same thing with the Gold Rush. &quot;Gold. Gold. Gold.&quot;
											Sixty-eight rich men on the Steamer Portland. Stacks of yellow metal.
											Some have 5,000. Many have more.
											A few bring out 100,000 dollars each.
											People would get very excited about this when they read these articles.
											&quot;The Eldorado of the United States of America:
											the discovery of inexhaustible gold mines in California.&quot;
											And the parallels between the Gold Rush and the Internet Rush continue very strongly.
											So many people left what they were doing.

											People on the East Coast in 1849, when they first started to get the news,
											they thought, &quot;Ah, this isn&#39;t real.&quot;
											But they keep hearing about people getting rich,
											and then in 1850 they still hear that. And they think it&#39;s not real.
											By about 1852, they&#39;re thinking, &quot;Am I the stupidest person on Earth
											by not rushing to California?&quot; And they start to decide they are.
											These are community affairs, by the way.
											Local communities on the East Coast would get together and whole teams
											of 10, 20 people would caravan across the United States,
											and they would form companies.
											These were typically not solitary efforts. But no matter what,
											if you were a lawyer or a banker, people dropped what they were doing,
											no matter what skill set they had, to go pan for gold.

											In the Gold Rush, people literally jumped ship.
											The San Francisco harbor was clogged with 600 ships at the peak
											because the ships would get there and the crews would abandon

											a fact we were unaware of, until after the miserable wretches
											turned beneath the hooves of our cavalcade.
											The eyeless sockets of the pack animals everywhere

											And that was, of course, the very common story.
											Because when you take out that last piece of gold —
											and they did incredibly quickly. I mean, if you look at the 1849 Gold Rush —
											the entire American river region, within two years —
											every stone had been turned. And after that, only big companies
											who used more sophisticated mining technologies
											started to take gold out of there.
											So there&#39;s a much better analogy that allows you to be incredibly optimistic
											and that analogy is the electric industry.
											And there are a lot of similarities between the Internet and the electric industry.
											With the electric industry you actually have to —
											one of them is that they&#39;re both sort of thin,
											horizontal, enabling layers that go across lots of different industries.

											But electricity is also very, very broad, so you have to sort of narrow it down.
											You know, it can be used as an incredible means of transmitting power.
											It&#39;s an incredible means of coordinating,
											in a very fine-grained way, information flows.
											There&#39;s a bunch of things that are interesting about electricity.
											And the part of the electric revolution that I want to focus on
											is sort of the golden age of appliances.
											The killer app that got the world ready for appliances was the light bulb.
											So the light bulb is what wired the world.
											And they weren&#39;t thinking about appliances when they wired the world.
											They were really thinking about —
											they weren&#39;t putting electricity into the home;
											they were putting lighting into the home.
											And, but it really — it got the electricity. It took a long time.

											This was a huge — as you would expect — a huge capital build out.
											All the streets had to be torn up.
											This is work going on down in lower Manhattan
											where they built some of the first electric power generating stations.
											And they&#39;re tearing up all the streets.
											The Edison Electric Company, which became Edison General Electric,
											which became General Electric,
											paid for all of this digging up of the streets. It was incredibly expensive.
											But that is not the — and that&#39;s not the part that&#39;s really most similar to the Web.
											Because, remember, the Web got to stand
											on top of all this heavy infrastructure
											that had been put in place because of the long-distance phone network.
											So all of the cabling and all of the heavy infrastructure —
											I&#39;m going back now to, sort of, the explosive part of the Web in 1994,
											when it was growing 2,300 percent a year.
											How could it grow at 2,300 percent a year in 1994

											So this was — remember, they didn&#39;t wire the houses for electricity.

											They have to — typically, they come three times.
											And one friend of mine was telling me a story:
											not only did they get there and have to wait,
											but then the engineers, when they finally did get there,
											for the third time, they had to call somebody.
											And they were really happy that the guy had a speakerphone
											because then they had to wait on hold for an hour
											to talk to somebody to give them an access code
											after they got there.
											So we&#39;re not — we&#39;re pretty kludge-y ourselves.

											By the way, DSL is a kludge.
											I mean, this is a twisted pair of copper that was never designed
											for the purpose it&#39;s being put to —
											you know it&#39;s the whole thing —
											we&#39;re very, very primitive. And that&#39;s kind of the point.
											Because, you know, resilience — if you think of it in terms of the Gold Rush,
											then you&#39;d be pretty depressed right now
											because the last nugget of gold would be gone.
											But the good thing is, with innovation, there isn&#39;t a last nugget.
											Every new thing creates two new questions and two new opportunities.

									<p>
											And if you believe that, then you believe that where we are —
											this is what I think — I believe that where we are with the incredible kludge —
											and I haven&#39;t even talked about user interfaces on the Web —
											but there&#39;s so much kludge, so much terrible stuff —
											we are at the 1908 Hurley washing machine stage with the Internet.
											That&#39;s where we are. We don&#39;t get our hair caught in it,
											but that&#39;s the level of primitiveness of where we are.
											We&#39;re in 1908.

											And if you believe that, then stuff like this doesn&#39;t bother you. This is 1996:
											&quot;All the negatives add up to making the online experience not worth the trouble.&quot;
											1998: &quot;Amazon.toast.&quot; In 1999: &quot;Amazon.bomb.&quot;

											She — but you know, if you really do believe that it&#39;s the very,
											very beginning, if you believe it&#39;s the 1908 Hurley washing machine,
											then you&#39;re incredibly optimistic. And I do think that that&#39;s where we are.
											And I do think there&#39;s more innovation ahead of us
											than there is behind us.
											And in 1917, Sears — I want to get this exactly right.
											This was the advertisement that they ran in 1917.
											It says: &quot;Use your electricity for more than light.&quot;
											And I think that&#39;s where we are.
											We&#39;re very, very early. Thank you very much.
