											I was born in 1947, a long time ago,
											and when I was 18 months old, I had polio.
											I was in an iron lung for three months
											and in and out of the hospital
for three years.
											Now, we had lots of neighbors
in our Brooklyn neighborhood,
											and some of them were really
very helpful for my parents.
											Some of them were really
afraid of contagion,
											and they wouldn&#39;t even walk
in front of our house.
											They would literally
walk across the street.
											I think this was a time
when my family really began to realize
											what disability meant to some people:
											fear.

											And it wasn&#39;t even a sure thing
that I would live at home,
											although I didn&#39;t learn about this
until I was 36 years old.
											I was having a discussion
with my father one night,
											and he said, &quot;You know,
when you were two years old,
											one of the doctors
suggested to your mom and I
											that you live in an institution,
											that they could just
go ahead with their lives
											and raise their kids
											and kind of be done with having to deal
with all the disability-related things.
											I didn&#39;t believe my father,
not because he was a liar,
											but I&#39;d never heard this story,
											and my mother in fact validated that.
											She never wanted to tell me.

											But in reality, I don&#39;t know why
I was really surprised by this story,
											because when I was five years old,
											and my mother, like mothers and fathers
all across the United States,
											was taking me to school to enroll,
											she pushed my wheelchair to the school
in walking distance to our house,
											pulled the wheelchair
up the steps into the school,
											and we were greeted by the principal.
											Not really greeted.
											But the principal said,
no, I couldn&#39;t come to that school
											because it wasn&#39;t accessible.
											But he told us not to worry,
											because the Board of Education in fact
would send a teacher to my house.
											And they did
											for a total of two and a half hours
											a week.

											I didn&#39;t actually get to go to school
in a real building
											until I was nine years old,
											and then I was in classes
only with disabled children
											in a school that had
mainly nondisabled children.
											And in my classes,
											there were students up to the age of 21.
											And then, after 21,
											they went to something
called sheltered workshops
											with menial work
											and earning either nothing
or below minimum wage.
											So I understood discrimination.
											My parents understood discrimination.

who left in the 1930s,

											My parents lost family
and they lost parents.

their parents in the Holocaust.

											They learned that because
I used a wheelchair,
											none of the high schools
in New York City, in the entire city,
											were wheelchair accessible,
											so what was supposed to happen
											is I was supposed to go
back onto home instruction
											along with many other students.
											So my parents banded together
with other parents.
											They went to the Board of Education
											and they demanded that the Board of Ed
make some of the high schools accessible.
											And they did.
											And so I and many others
											were finally able to go to high school,
a regular high school,

											So what happened next?
											I was learning more and more
about what discrimination was,
											and equally important, I was learning
that I needed to become my own advocate.
											I was entering college,
Long Island University,
											and I had always wanted to be a teacher,
											and so I minored in education
and I took all the appropriate courses,
											and then when it was time
for me to go for my license,
											I had to take a written exam,
											an oral exam
											and a medical exam.
											At that time, all three of those exams
											were given in completely
inaccessible buildings,

up and down the steps
											for these exams,

											That was not one of them.
											And I was freaked out in the first place
											because I had heard
											that there were actually
no disabled people using wheelchairs
											who were teachers in New York,

I was expecting something bad.
											So I said to her,
											is it a requirement
that teachers show their students

											So what was I going to do?

challenging the system, me,

of other friends who had disabilities
											who were encouraging me
to move forward with this,
											it was nonetheless quite frightening.
											But I was really very lucky.
											I had a friend who was a disabled student
at Long Island University
											and was also a stringer
at the &quot;New York Times,&quot;
											and he was able to get a reporter
											to write a really good piece
about what had happened
											and why he thought
what had happened was wrong.
											The next day there was an editorial
in the &quot;New York Times&quot;
											with the title of
&quot;Heumann v. The Board of Education&quot;
											and the &quot;New York Times&quot;
came out in support
											of my getting my teaching license.

											who are 50 or older,
or maybe or even 40 or older,
											you remember a time when
there were no ramps on the streets,
											when buses were not accessible,
											when trains were not accessible,
											where there were no wheelchair-accessible
bathrooms in shopping malls,
											where you certainly did not have
a sign language interpreter,
											or captioning, or braille
or other kinds of supports.
											These things have changed,
											and they have inspired the world.
											And disabled people around the world
want laws like we have,
											and they want those laws enforced.

											And so what we&#39;ve seen is something called
											the Convention on the Rights
of Persons with Disabilities.
											It is a treaty that was adopted in 2006.
											It&#39;s celebrating is 10-year anniversary.
											More than 165 countries
have joined this treaty.
											It is the first international
human rights treaty
											fully focused on disabled people.
											But I am sad to say that our US Senate
											has failed to recommend to our president
that we ratify the treaty.
											We signed it in 2009,
											but it doesn&#39;t come
into force until ratification,
											and the president —
no president can ratify a treaty
											without the consent of the Senate.
											So we feel really strongly
											that our US Senate needs to do its job,
											that our Senate needs
to enable us as Americans
											not only to be able to assist disabled
people and governments around the world
											to learn about the good work
that we&#39;ve been doing,
											but it&#39;s equally important
											that disabled people
have the same opportunities
											to travel, study and work abroad
											as anyone else in our country.
											And as long as many countries
don&#39;t have the same laws as we do
											and don&#39;t enforce them if they have them,
											opportunities for disabled people
are more limited.

											When I travel abroad,
											I am always meeting with disabled women,
											and those women tell me stories
											about how they experience
violence and rape
											and how in many cases
these forms of violence
											occur from family members
and people that they know,
											who in fact may be working for them.
											And frequently these cases
are not adjudicated.
											I meet disabled people
											who have been offered jobs by businesses
											because they live in a country
where there&#39;s a quota system,
											and in order to avoid a fine,
											they will hire you
											and then tell you,
											&quot;You don&#39;t need to come to work
											because we really don&#39;t need you
in the facility.&quot;
											I have visited institutions
											where the stench of urine is so strong
											that before you open
the door of your vehicle,
											you&#39;re kind of pushed back,
											and then gone into those institutions
											where people should be living
in the community with appropriate supports
											and seen people almost naked,
											people who are chemically drugged
											and people who are living
lives of despair.
											These are some of the things that the US
needs to be doing more to correct.
											We know discrimination when we see it,
											and we need to be fighting it together.

											So what is it that we can
be doing together?
											I encourage you all to recognize
											that disability is a family
you can join at any point in your life.
											I&#39;d like to see by a show of hands
how many of you have ever broken a bone?
											And then, when you leave today, I&#39;d like
you to maybe write a couple of sentences
											about what that period of time
has been like for you,
											because frequently I hear from people,
											&quot;You know, I couldn&#39;t do this,
I couldn&#39;t do that.
											People talked to me differently.
They acted differently towards me.&quot;
											And that&#39;s what I see
and other disabled people see
											in flashing letters.

Heumann&nbsp;determined that she, working in collaboration with other disabled people, had to play an increasing advocacy role as she and others experienced continuous discrimination because of their disabilities. She is now an internationally recognized leader in the disability rights community and a lifelong civil rights advocate. As a Senior Fellow at the Ford Foundation, she is currently working to help advance the inclusion of disability in the Foundation&rsquo;s work and is leading a project to advance the inclusion of disabled people in the media.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>President Obama appointed Heumann&nbsp;as the first Special Advisor for International Disability Rights at the US Department of State, where she served from 2010-2017.

","whylisten":"<p>Judith (Judy) Heumann contracted polio in 1949 in Brooklyn, NY and began to experience discrimination at five years old when she was denied the right to attend school because she was a &quot;fire hazard.&quot; Her parents played a strong role in fighting for her rights as a child. Heumann&nbsp;determined that she, working in collaboration with other disabled people, had to play an increasing advocacy role as she and others experienced continuous discrimination because of their disabilities. She is now an internationally recognized leader in the disability rights community and a lifelong civil rights advocate. As a Senior Fellow at the Ford Foundation, she is currently working to help advance the inclusion of disability in the Foundation&rsquo;s work and is leading a project to advance the inclusion of disabled people in the media.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>President Obama appointed Heumann&nbsp;as the first Special Advisor for International Disability Rights at the US Department of State, where she served from 2010-2017. Prior to this position, she served as the Director for the Department on Disability Services for the District of Columbia, where she was responsible for the Developmental Disability Administration and the Rehabilitation Services Administration.</p><p>From June 2002- 2006, Heumann&nbsp;served as the World Bank&#39;s first Adviser on Disability and Development. In this position, she led the World Bank&#39;s disability work to expand the Bank&rsquo;s knowledge and capability to work with governments and civil society on including disability in the global conversation. From 1993 to 2001, Heumann&nbsp;served in the Clinton Administration as the Assistant Secretary for the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services in the Department of Education. She was also responsible for the implementation of legislation at the national level for programs in special education, disability research, vocational rehabilitation and independent living, serving more than 8 million youth and adults with disabilities.</p><p>Heumann graduated from Long Island University in Brooklyn, NY in 1969 and received her Master&rsquo;s in Public Health from the University of California at Berkeley in 1975. Her goal in life is to continue to advance the rights and empowerment of ALL disabled people around the world. She is also currently building an online presence through The Heumann Perspective which can found on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/TheHeumannPerspective/\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCB7pemkbDQYezB6PeDFXTvg\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/judithheumann\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a>.</p>"}],"speaker_name":"Judith Heumann","tags":["activism","education","disability","community","humanity","identity","personal growth","leadership","social change","society","TEDx"],"title":"Our fight for disability rights -- and why we're not done yet","video_type":{"id":"2","name":"TEDx Talk"},"viewed_count":1109316}]}})</script></div>
