<meta content='Appearing by telepresence robot, Edward Snowden speaks at TED2014 about surveillance and Internet freedom. The right to data privacy, he suggests, is not a partisan issue, but requires a fundamental rethink of the role of the internet in our lives — and the laws that protect it. "Your rights matter," he says, "because you never know when you&#x0027;re going to need them." Chris Anderson interviews, with special guest Tim Berners-Lee.' itemprop='description'>

											CA: So just to give some context
											for those who don&#39;t know the whole story —
											(Applause) —
											this time a year ago, you were stationed in Hawaii
											working as a consultant to the NSA.
											As a sysadmin, you had access
											to their systems,
											and you began revealing
certain classified documents
											to some handpicked journalists
											leading the way to June&#39;s revelations.
											Now, what propelled you to do this?
											ES: You know,
											when I was sitting in Hawaii,
											and the years before, when I was
working in the intelligence community,
											I saw a lot of things that had disturbed me.
											We do a lot of good things
in the intelligence community,
											things that need to be done,
											and things that help everyone.
											But there are also things that go too far.
											There are things that shouldn&#39;t be done,
											and decisions that were being made in secret
											without the public&#39;s awareness,
											without the public&#39;s consent,
											and without even our representatives in government
											having knowledge of these programs.
											When I really came to struggle with these issues,
											I thought to myself,
											how can I do this in the most responsible way,
											that maximizes the public benefit
											while minimizing the risks?
											And out of all the solutions that I could come up with,
											out of going to Congress,
											when there were no laws,
											there were no legal protections
											for a private employee,
											a contractor in intelligence like myself,
											there was a risk that I would be
buried along with the information
											and the public would never find out.
											But the First Amendment of
the United States Constitution
											guarantees us a free press for a reason,
											and that&#39;s to enable an adversarial press,
											to challenge the government,
											but also to work together with the government,
											to have a dialogue and debate about how we can
											inform the public about matters of vital importance
											without putting our national security at risk.
											And by working with journalists,
											by giving all of my information
											back to the American people,
											rather than trusting myself to make
											the decisions about publication,
											we&#39;ve had a robust debate
											with a deep investment by the government
											that I think has resulted in a benefit for everyone.
											And the risks that have been threatened,
											the risks that have been played up
											by the government
											have never materialized.
											We&#39;ve never seen any evidence
											of even a single instance of specific harm,
											and because of that,
											I&#39;m comfortable with the decisions that I made.

									<p>
											ES: The best way to understand PRISM,
											because there&#39;s been a little bit of controversy,
											is to first talk about what PRISM isn&#39;t.
											Much of the debate in the U.S.
has been about metadata.
											They&#39;ve said it&#39;s just metadata, it&#39;s just metadata,
											and they&#39;re talking about a specific legal authority
											called Section 215 of the Patriot Act.
											That allows sort of a warrantless wiretapping,
											mass surveillance of the entire country&#39;s
											phone records, things like that —
											who you&#39;re talking to,
											when you&#39;re talking to them,
											where you traveled.
											These are all metadata events.
											PRISM is about content.
											It&#39;s a program through which the government could
											compel corporate America,
											it could deputize corporate America
											to do its dirty work for the NSA.
											And even though some of
these companies did resist,
											even though some of them —
											I believe Yahoo was one of them —
											challenged them in court, they all lost,
											because it was never tried by an open court.
											They were only tried by a secret court.
											And something that we&#39;ve seen,
											something about the PRISM program
that&#39;s very concerning to me is,
											there&#39;s been a talking point in the U.S. government
											where they&#39;ve said 15 federal judges
											have reviewed these programs
and found them to be lawful,
											but what they don&#39;t tell you
											is those are secret judges
											in a secret court
											based on secret interpretations of law
											that&#39;s considered 34,000 warrant requests
											over 33 years,
											and in 33 years only rejected
											11 government requests.
											These aren&#39;t the people that we want deciding
											what the role of corporate America
											in a free and open Internet should be.

											CA: Now, this slide that we&#39;re showing here
											shows the dates in which
											different technology companies, Internet companies,
											are alleged to have joined the program,
											and where data collection began from them.
											Now, they have denied collaborating with the NSA.
											How was that data collected by the NSA?

									<p>
											ES: Right. So the NSA&#39;s own slides
											refer to it as direct access.
											What that means to an actual NSA analyst,
											someone like me who was working
as an intelligence analyst
											targeting, Chinese cyber-hackers,
											things like that, in Hawaii,
											is the provenance of that data
											is directly from their servers.
											It doesn&#39;t mean
											that there&#39;s a group of company representatives
											sitting in a smoky room with the NSA
											palling around and making back-room deals
											about how they&#39;re going to give this stuff away.
											Now each company handles it different ways.
											Some are responsible.
											Some are somewhat less responsible.
											But the bottom line is, when we talk about
											how this information is given,
											it&#39;s coming from the companies themselves.
											It&#39;s not stolen from the lines.
											But there&#39;s an important thing to remember here:
											even though companies pushed back,
											even though companies demanded,
											hey, let&#39;s do this through a warrant process,
											let&#39;s do this
											where we actually have some sort of legal review,
											some sort of basis for handing over
											these users&#39; data,
											we saw stories in the Washington Post last year
											that weren&#39;t as well reported as the PRISM story
											that said the NSA broke in
											to the data center communications
											between Google to itself
											and Yahoo to itself.
											So even these companies that are cooperating
											in at least a compelled but hopefully lawful manner
											with the NSA,
											the NSA isn&#39;t satisfied with that,
											and because of that, we need our companies
											to work very hard
											to guarantee that they&#39;re going to represent
											the interests of the user, and also advocate
											for the rights of the users.
											And I think over the last year,
											we&#39;ve seen the companies that are named
											on the PRISM slides
											take great strides to do that,
											and I encourage them to continue.

											ES: The biggest thing that an Internet company
											in America can do today, right now,
											without consulting with lawyers,
											to protect the rights of users worldwide,
											is to enable SSL web encryption
											on every page you visit.
											The reason this matters is today,
											if you go to look at a copy of &quot;1984&quot; on Amazon.com,
											the NSA can see a record of that,
											the Russian intelligence service
can see a record of that,
											the Chinese service can see a record of that,
											the French service, the German service,
											the services of Andorra.
											They can all see it because it&#39;s unencrypted.
											The world&#39;s library is Amazon.com,
											but not only do they not
support encryption by default,
											you cannot choose to use encryption
											when browsing through books.
											This is something that we need to change,
											not just for Amazon, I don&#39;t mean to single them out,
											but they&#39;re a great example.
											All companies need to move
											to an encrypted browsing habit by default
											for all users who haven&#39;t taken any action
											or picked any special methods on their own.
											That&#39;ll increase the privacy and the rights
											that people enjoy worldwide.

											ES: So, I&#39;ve got to give credit to the NSA
											for using appropriate names on this.
											This is one of my favorite NSA cryptonyms.
											Boundless Informant
											is a program that the NSA hid from Congress.
											The NSA was previously asked by Congress,
											was there any ability that they had
											to even give a rough ballpark estimate
											of the amount of American communications
											that were being intercepted.
											They said no. They said, we don&#39;t track those stats,
											and we can&#39;t track those stats.
											We can&#39;t tell you how many communications
											we&#39;re intercepting around the world,
											because to tell you that would be
											to invade your privacy.
											Now, I really appreciate that sentiment from them,
											but the reality, when you look at this slide is,
											not only do they have the capability,
											the capability already exists.
											It&#39;s already in place.
											The NSA has its own internal data format
											that tracks both ends of a communication,
											and if it says,
											this communication came from America,
											they can tell Congress how
many of those communications
											they have today, right now.
											And what Boundless Informant tells us
											is more communications are being intercepted
											in America about Americans
											than there are in Russia about Russians.
											I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s what an intelligence agency
											should be aiming for.

											ES: We also heard in Congressional
testimony last year,
											it was an amazing thing for someone like me
											who came from the NSA
											and who&#39;s seen the actual internal documents,
											knows what&#39;s in them,
											to see officials testifying under oath
											that there had been no abuses,
											that there had been no violations of the NSA&#39;s rules,
											when we knew this story was coming.
											But what&#39;s especially interesting about this,
											about the fact that the NSA has violated
											their own rules, their own laws
											thousands of times in a single year,
											including one event by itself,
											one event out of those 2,776,
											that affected more than 3,000 people.
											In another event, they intercepted
											all the calls in Washington, D.C., by accident.
											What&#39;s amazing about this,
											this report, that didn&#39;t get that much attention,
											is the fact that not only were there 2,776 abuses,
											the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee,
											Dianne Feinstein, had not seen this report
											until the Washington Post contacted her
											asking for comment on the report.
											And she then requested a copy from the NSA
											and received it,
											but had never seen this before that.
											What does that say about the state of oversight
											in American intelligence
											when the chairman of the
Senate Intelligence Committee
											has no idea that the rules are being broken
											thousands of times every year?

											CA: Ed, one response to this whole debate is this:
											Why should we care about
											all this surveillance, honestly?
											I mean, look, if you&#39;ve done nothing wrong,
											you&#39;ve got nothing to worry about.
											What&#39;s wrong with that point of view?
											ES: Well, so the first thing is,
											you&#39;re giving up your rights.
											You&#39;re saying hey, you know,
											I don&#39;t think I&#39;m going to need them,

you&#39;re going to need them.
											Beyond that, it&#39;s a part of our cultural identity,
											not just in America,
											but in Western societies
											and in democratic societies around the world.
											People should be able to pick up the phone
											and to call their family,
											people should be able to send a text message

											about this particular revelation.
											Come and take a look at this.
											I mean, this is a story which I think
for a lot of the techies in this room
											is the single most shocking thing
											that they have heard in the last few months.
											It&#39;s about a program called &quot;Bullrun.&quot;
											Can you explain what that is?

											ES: So Bullrun, and this is again
											where we&#39;ve got to thank the NSA for their candor,
											this is a program named after a Civil War battle.
											The British counterpart is called Edgehill,
											which is a U.K. civil war battle.
											And the reason that I believe they&#39;re named this way
											is because they target our own infrastructure.
											They&#39;re programs through which the NSA
											intentionally misleads corporate partners.
											They tell corporate partners that these
											are safe standards.
											They say hey, we need to work with you
											to secure your systems,
											but in reality, they&#39;re giving bad advice
											to these companies that makes them
											degrade the security of their services.
											They&#39;re building in backdoors that not only
											the NSA can exploit,
											but anyone else who has time and money
											to research and find it
											can then use to let themselves in
											to the world&#39;s communications.
											And this is really dangerous,
											because if we lose a single standard,
											if we lose the trust of something like SSL,
											which was specifically targeted
											by the Bullrun program,
											we will live a less safe world overall.
											We won&#39;t be able to access our banks
											and we won&#39;t be able to access commerce
											without worrying about people
monitoring those communications
											or subverting them for their own ends.

											ES: Absolutely.
											One of the problems,
											one of the dangerous legacies
											that we&#39;ve seen in the post-9/11 era,
											is that the NSA has traditionally worn two hats.
											They&#39;ve been in charge of offensive operations,
											that is hacking,
											but they&#39;ve also been in
charge of defensive operations,
											and traditionally they&#39;ve always prioritized
											defense over offense
											based on the principle
											that American secrets are simply worth more.
											If we hack a Chinese business
											and steal their secrets,
											if we hack a government office in Berlin
											and steal their secrets,
											that has less value to the American people
											than making sure that the Chinese
											can&#39;t get access to our secrets.
											So by reducing the security of our communications,
											they&#39;re not only putting the world at risk,
											they&#39;re putting America at risk in a fundamental way,
											because intellectual property is the basis,
											the foundation of our economy,
											and if we put that at risk through weak security,
											we&#39;re going to be paying for it for years.

											because we&#39;ve had the first open court,
											the first federal court that&#39;s reviewed this,
											outside the secrecy arrangement,
											called these programs Orwellian
											and likely unconstitutional.
											Congress, who has access

											said these programs have never stopped

											ES: Yeah. The bottom line is that terrorism
											has always been what we in the intelligence world
											would call a cover for action.
											Terrorism is something that provokes
											an emotional response that allows people
											to rationalize authorizing powers and programs
											that they wouldn&#39;t give otherwise.
											The Bullrun and Edgehill-type programs,
											the NSA asked for these authorities
											back in the 1990s.
											They asked the FBI to go to
Congress and make the case.
											The FBI went to Congress and did make the case.
											But Congress and the American people said no.
											They said, it&#39;s not worth the risk to our economy.
											They said it&#39;s worth too much damage
											to our society to justify the gains.
											But what we saw is, in the post-9/11 era,
											they used secrecy and they
used the justification of terrorism
											to start these programs in secret
											without asking Congress,
											without asking the American people,
											and it&#39;s that kind of government behind closed doors

											some kind of deal,
											that they want me to compromise
											the journalists with which I&#39;ve been working,
											to come back,
											and I want to make it very clear
											that I did not do this to be safe.
											I did this to do what was right,
											and I&#39;m not going to stop my work
											in the public interest
											just to benefit myself.

											CA: At TED, the mission is &quot;ideas worth spreading.&quot;
											If you could encapsulate it in a single idea,
											what is your idea worth spreading
											right now at this moment?
											ES: I would say the last year has been a reminder
											that democracy may die behind closed doors,
											but we as individuals are born
											behind those same closed doors,
											and we don&#39;t have to give up
											our privacy to have good government.
											We don&#39;t have to give up our liberty

2013 Edward Snowden leaked thousands of classified American National Security Agency documents, sparking a global conversation about citizens' rights to privacy on the Internet.","whylisten":"<p>Edward Snowden was just about to turn 28 when his face was suddenly splashed across every major newspaper in the US. In the summer of 2013 <em>The Guardian</em> published a series of leaked documents about the American National Security Agency (NSA), starting with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/nsa-phone-records-verizon-court-order\" target=\"_blank\">an article</a>  about a secret court order demanding American phone records from Verizon, followed by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/us-tech-giants-nsa-data\" target=\"_blank\">an article</a>  on the NSA&#39;s top-secret Prism program, said to be accessing user data from Google, Apple and Facebook. </p><p>It wasn&#39;t long before Snowden <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/09/edward-snowden-nsa-whistleblower-surveillance\" target=\"_blank\">came forward</a>  as the source, revealing that he had carefully planned the leak, copying documents when he was working as a contractor for the NSA. &quot;I understand that I will be made to suffer for my actions,&quot; he <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/09/edward-snowden-nsa-whistleblower-surveillance\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> at the time, but &quot;I will be satisfied if the federation of secret law, unequal pardon and irresistible executive powers that rule the world that I love are revealed even for an instant.&quot; Snowden&#39;s actions have led to a global debate on the relationship between national security and online privacy. His leaks continue to have a lasting impact on the American public&#39;s view of the government, and has encouraged media scrutiny on the NSA.</p><p>Snowden had coordinated the leak with journalist Glenn Greenwald and filmmaker Laura Poitras from Hong Kong; after he revealed his identity, he fled and ended up in Moscow. Under charges of espionage by the American government, Snowden remains in Russia in temporary asylum.</p>"}],"speaker_name":"Edward Snowden","tags":["Internet","journalism","law","surveillance","encryption"],"title":"Here's how we take back the Internet","video_type":{"id":"1","name":"TED Stage Talk"},"viewed_count":4648199}]}})</script></div>
