											After 25 years of working on issues of

											They must navigate markets daily,
											making micro-decisions, dozens and dozens,

											Patient capital works between,

											It&#39;s money that&#39;s invested in entrepreneurs who know their communities

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											I want to share one story
											about an innovation called drip irrigation.
											In 2002 I met this incredible entrepreneur
											named Amitabha Sadangi from India,
											who&#39;d been working for 20 years with some of the poorest farmers on the planet.
											And he was expressing his frustration
											that the aid market had bypassed low-income farmers altogether,
											despite the fact that 200 million farmers
											alone in India make under a dollar a day.
											They were creating subsidies
											either for large farms,
											or they were giving inputs to the farmers
											that they thought they should use, rather than
											that the farmers wanted to use.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											At the same time Amitabha was
											obsessed with this drip irrigation technology
											that had been invented in Israel.
											It was a way of bringing small amounts of water
											directly to the stalk of the plant.
											And it could transform
											swaths of desert land into fields of emerald green.
											But the market also had bypassed low income farmers,
											because these systems were both too expensive,
											and they were constructed for fields that were too large.
											The average small village farmer
											works on two acres or less.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And so, Amitabha decided that he would take that innovation
											and he would redesign it from the perspective
											of the poor farmers themselves,
											because he spent so many years listening to what they needed
											not what he thought that they should have.
											And he used three fundamental principles.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											The first one was miniaturization.
											The drip irrigation system
											had to be small enough that a farmer only had
											to risk a quarter acre,
											even if he had two,
											because it was too frightening, given all that he had at stake.
											Second, it had to be extremely affordable.
											In other words, that risk on the quarter acre
											needed to be repaid in a single harvest,
											or else they wouldn&#39;t take the risk.
											And third, it had to be what Amitabha calls
											infinitely expandable.
											What I mean is with the profits from the first quarter acre,
											the farmers could buy a second
											and a third and a fourth.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											As of today, IDE India, Amitabha&#39;s organization,
											has sold over 300,000 farmers these systems
											and has seen their yields and incomes
											double or triple on average,
											but this didn&#39;t happen overnight.
											In fact, when you go back to the beginning,
											there were no private investors
											who would be willing to take a risk on building a new technology
											for a market class that made under a dollar a day,
											that were known to be some of the most risk-averse people on the planet
											and that were working in one of the riskiest sectors, agriculture.

									<p>
											And so we needed grants. And he used significant grants
											to research, to experiment, to fail,
											to innovate and try again.
											And when he had a prototype
											and had a better understanding of how to market to farmers,
											that&#39;s when patient capital could come in.
											And we helped him build a company, for profit,
											that would build on IDE&#39;s knowledge,
											and start looking at sales and exports,
											and be able to tap into other kinds of capital.

											Secondarily, we wanted to see if we could export
											this drip irrigation and bring it into other countries.
											And so we met Dr. Sono Khangharani in Pakistan.
											And while, again, you needed patience
											to move a technology for the poor
											in India into Pakistan,
											just to get the permits,
											over time we were able to start a company
											with Dr. Sono, who runs a large
											community development organization in the Thar Desert,
											which is one of the remote and poorest areas of the country.
											And though that company has just started,
											our assumption is that there too
											we&#39;ll see the impact on millions.

											And so I urge you, in whatever sector you work,
											in whatever job you do,
											to start thinking about how we might
											build solutions that start
											from the perspective of those we&#39;re trying to help.
											Rather than what we think that they might need.
											It will take embracing the world with both arms.
											And it will take living with the spirit of generosity and accountability,
											with a sense of integrity and perseverance.
											And yet these are the very qualities
											for which men and women have been honored
											throughout the generations.
											And there is so much good that we can do.
											Just think of all those sunflowers in the desert.
											Thank you.
											(Applause)

So I moved to Rwanda in 1986 to help found the country&rsquo;s first micro-finance bank.  There I saw the humanitarian ethos of philanthropy, and also how often top-down solutions too often create dependency, the opposite of dignity. Through 30 years of working on solutions to poverty, I have come to redefine it for myself, seeing it not as how much income a person earns, but how free they are to make their own choices and decisions, how much agency they have over their own lives.  <br /> <br />Acumen was founded to change the way the world tackles poverty in 2001.  Our mission was simple &ndash; to raise philanthropy and  invest it as patient capital &ndash; long-term investment in intrepid entrepreneurs willing to go where markets and government had failed the poor.  We enable companies to experiment and fail, never wavering from a commitment to stand with the poor, yet understanding that profitability is necessary for sustainable solutions. We&rsquo;ve invested more than $110M across South Asia, Africa, Latin America and the US, and have seen entire sectors disrupted and hundreds of millions served.  <br /> <br />The work also taught that it was critical to invest in talent. To date, we&rsquo;ve supported nearly 400 Acumen Fellows across lines of race, class, ethnicity, religion and ideology.
