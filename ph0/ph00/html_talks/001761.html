<title>Michael Murphy: Architecture that&#39;s built to heal | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Architecture is more than a clever arrangement of bricks. In this eloquent talk, Michael Murphy shows how he and his team look far beyond the blueprint when they&#39;re designing. Considering factors from airflow to light, theirs is a holistic approach that produces community as well as (beautiful) buildings. He takes us on a tour of projects in countries such as Rwanda and Haiti, and reveals a moving, ambitious plan for The Memorial to Peace and Justice, which he hopes will heal hearts in the American South." />

<meta content="Architecture that's built to heal" itemprop='name'>
<meta content="Architecture is more than a clever arrangement of bricks. In this eloquent talk, Michael Murphy shows how he and his team look far beyond the blueprint when they're designing. Considering factors from airflow to light, theirs is a holistic approach that produces community as well as (beautiful) buildings. He takes us on a tour of projects in countries such as Rwanda and Haiti, and reveals a moving, ambitious plan for The Memorial to Peace and Justice, which he hopes will heal hearts in the American South." itemprop='description'>

											Every weekend for as long
as I can remember,
											my father would get up on a Saturday,
											put on a worn sweatshirt
											and he&#39;d scrape away
											at the squeaky old wheel
of a house that we lived in.
											I wouldn&#39;t even call it restoration;
											it was a ritual, catharsis.
											He would spend all year
scraping paint with this old heat gun
											and a spackle knife,
											and then he would repaint
where he scraped,
											only to begin again the following year.
											Scraping and re-scraping,
painting and repainting:
											the work of an old house
is never meant to be done.

											Just as I was about to start
my final exams,
											I decided to take a break
from an all-nighter
											and go to a lecture by Dr. Paul Farmer,
											a leading health activist
for the global poor.
											I was surprised to hear a doctor
talking about architecture.
											Buildings are making
people sicker, he said,
											and for the poorest in the world,
											this is causing epidemic-level problems.
											In this hospital in South Africa,
											patients that came in
with, say, a broken leg,
											to wait in this unventilated hallway,
											walked out with a multidrug-resistant
strand of tuberculosis.
											Simple designs for infection control
had not been thought about,
											and people had died because of it.

											That following summer,
											I was in the back of a Land Rover
with a few classmates,
											bumping over the mountainous
hillside of Rwanda.
											For the next year, I&#39;d be living in Butaro
in this old guesthouse,
											which was a jail after the genocide.
											I was there to design and build
a new type of hospital
											with Dr. Farmer and his team.
											If hallways are making patients sicker,
											what if we could design a hospital
that flips the hallways on the outside,
											and makes people walk in the exterior?
											If mechanical systems rarely work,
											what if we could design a hospital
that could breathe
											through natural ventilation,
											and meanwhile reduce
its environmental footprint?

											Evidence shows
that a simple view of nature

had a window with a view?
											Simple, site-specific designs
can make a hospital that heals.

											We worked with Bruce Nizeye,
											a brilliant engineer,
											and he thought about
construction differently
											than I had been taught in school.
											When we had to excavate
this enormous hilltop
											and a bulldozer was expensive
and hard to get to site,
											Bruce suggested doing it by hand,
											using a method in Rwanda called &quot;Ubudehe,&quot;
											which means &quot;community works
for the community.&quot;
											Hundreds of people came
with shovels and hoes,
											and we excavated that hill
											in half the time and half
the cost of that bulldozer.
											Instead of importing furniture,
Bruce started a guild,
											and he brought in
master carpenters to train others
											in how to make furniture by hand.
											And on this job site,
											15 years after the Rwandan genocide,
											Bruce insisted that we bring on
labor from all backgrounds,
											and that half of them be women.

											Bruce was using
the process of building to heal,
											not just for those who were sick,
											but for the entire community as a whole.
											We call this the locally fabricated
way of building, or &quot;lo-fab,&quot;
											and it has four pillars:
											hire locally,
											source regionally,
											train where you can
											and most importantly,
											think about every design decision
as an opportunity
											to invest in the dignity
of the places where you serve.
											Think of it like the local food movement,
											but for architecture.
											And we&#39;re convinced
that this way of building
											can be replicated across the world,
											and change the way we talk about
and evaluate architecture.

											Using the lo-fab way of building,
											even aesthetic decisions
can be designed to impact people&#39;s lives.
											In Butaro, we chose to use
a local volcanic stone
											found in abundance within the area,
											but often considered
a nuisance by farmers,
											and piled on the side of the road.
											We worked with these masons
to cut these stones
											and form them into the walls
of the hospital.
											And when they began on this corner
											and wrapped around the entire hospital,
											they were so good at putting
these stones together,
											they asked us if they could take down
the original wall and rebuild it.
											And you see what is possible.
											It&#39;s beautiful.
											And the beauty, to me,
											comes from the fact that I know
that hands cut these stones,
											and they formed them into this thick wall,
											made only in this place
with rocks from this soil.

											When you go outside today

											Malawi has one of the highest rates
of maternal and infant death

											When my father told me
that day that this house —
											our house —
											had saved his life,
											what I didn&#39;t know
											was that he was referring
to a much deeper relationship
											between architecture and ourselves.
											Buildings are not simply
expressive sculptures.
											They make visible our personal
and our collective aspirations
											as a society.
											Great architecture can give us hope.
											Great architecture can heal.
