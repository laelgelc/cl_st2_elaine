											So my grandfather told me when I was a little girl,
											&quot;If you say a word often enough, it becomes you.&quot;
											And having grown up in a segregated city, Baltimore, Maryland,
											I sort of use that idea to go around America with a tape recorder —
											thank God for technology —
											to interview people, thinking that if I walked in their words —
											which is also why I don&#39;t wear shoes when I perform —
											if I walked in their words, that I could sort of absorb America.
											I was also inspired by Walt Whitman,
											who wanted to absorb America and have it absorb him.

											So these four characters are going to be from that work

											Anybody out here old enough to know Studs Terkel, that old radio man?
											So I thought he would be the perfect person
											to go to to ask about a defining moment in American history.
											You know, he was &quot;born in 1912, the year the Titanic sank,

											So this is his answer about a defining moment in American history.
											&quot;Defining moment in American history, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s one;
											you can&#39;t say Hiroshima, that&#39;s a big one —
											I can&#39;t think of any one moment I would say is a defining moment.
											The gradual slippage — &#39;slippage&#39; is the word
											used by the people in Watergate, moral slippage —

											&quot;Oh, let me kind of tell you a funny little play bit.
											The Atlanta airport is a modern airport,
											and they should leave the gate there.
											These trains that take you out to a concourse and on to a destination.
											And these trains are smooth,
											and they&#39;re quiet and they&#39;re efficient.
											And there&#39;s a voice on the train, you know the voice was a human voice.
											You see in the old days we had robots, robots imitated humans.
											Now we have humans imitating robots.
											So we got this voice on this train: Concourse One: Omaha, Lincoln.
											Concourse Two: Dallas, Fort Worth. Same voice.
											Just as a train is about to go, a young couple rush in
											and they&#39;re just about to close the pneumatic doors.
											And that voice, without losing a beat, says,
											&#39;Because of late entry, we&#39;re delayed 30 seconds.&#39;
											Just then, everybody&#39;s looking at this couple with hateful eyes
											and the couple&#39;s going like this, you know, shrinking.
											Well, I&#39;d happened to have had a couple of drinks before boarding —
											I do that to steel my nerves — and so
											I imitate a train call, holding my hand on my —
											&#39;George Orwell, your time has come,&#39; you see.
											Well, some of you are laughing. Everybody laughs
											when I say that, but not on this train. Silence.
											And so suddenly they&#39;re looking at me.
											So here I am with the couple, the three of us
											shrinking at the foot of Calvary about to be up, you know.

											Maxine Greene, who&#39;s a wonderful philosopher

											great, big philosophy kind of an organization —
											I went to her and asked her what are the two things

											And I still feel as though I&#39;ve got to get coffee
											for my male colleagues, even though I&#39;ve outlived most of them.&quot;

											I was in a doctor&#39;s office last CAT scan,
											and there was a Reader&#39;s Digest, October 2002.
											It was like, &#39;seven ways to get lucky.&#39; And it says
											if you want to get lucky,
											you know, you&#39;ve got to be around positive people.
											I mean, like even when I told my wife that you want to come out here
											and talk to me, she&#39;s like, &#39;She&#39;s just talking;
											she&#39;s just being nice to you. She&#39;s not going to do that.&#39;

									<p>
											&quot;And then you called me up and you said you wanted to come out here
											and interview me and she went and looked you up on the Internet.
											She said, &#39;Look who she is.
											You&#39;re not even going to be able to answer her questions.&#39;
											(Laughter)
											And she was saying you&#39;re going to make me look like an idiot
											because I&#39;ve never been to college,
											and I wouldn&#39;t be talking professional or anything.
											I said, &#39;Well look, the woman talked to me for four hours.
											You know, if I wasn&#39;t talking — you know,
											like, you know, she wanted me to talk,
											I don&#39;t think she would even come out here.&#39;

											&quot;Confidence? Well, I think I ride
											more out of determination than confidence.
											I mean, confidence is like, you know,
											you&#39;ve been on that bull before; you know you can ride him.
											I mean, confidence is kind of like being cocky, but in a good way.
											But determination, you know, it&#39;s like just, you know, &#39;Fuck the form,
											get the horn.&#39;
											(Laughter)
											That&#39;s Tuff Hedeman, in the movie &#39;8 Seconds.&#39;
											I mean, like, Pat O&#39;Mealey always said when I was a boy,
											he say, &#39;You know, you got more try than any kid I ever seen.&#39;
											And try and determination is the same thing.
											Determination is, like, you&#39;re going to hang on that bull,
											even if you&#39;re riding upside down.
											Determination&#39;s like, you&#39;re going to ride
											till your head hits the back of the dirt.

											Well, you know, I guess that&#39;d have to be the rodeo too.
											I mean, look how we are, the roughy family,
											palling around and shaking hands and wrestling around me.
											It&#39;s like, you know, racking up our credit cards on entry fees and gas.
											We ride together, we, you know, we, we eat together
											and we sleep together.
											I mean, I can&#39;t even imagine what it&#39;s going to be like
											the last day I rodeo. I mean, I&#39;ll be alright.
											I mean, I have my ranch and everything,

											&quot;Toughness? Well, we was in West Jordan, Utah, and this bull
											shoved my face right through the metal shoots in a —
											you know, busted my face all up and had to go to the hospital.
											And they had to sew me up and straighten my nose out.
											And I had to go and ride in the rodeo that night,
											so I didn&#39;t want them to put me under anesthesia,
											or whatever you call it. And so they sewed my face up.
											And then they had to straighten out my nose,
											and they took these rods and shoved them up my nose
											and went up through my brains
											and felt like it was coming out the top of my head,
											and everybody said that it should have killed me,
											but it didn&#39;t, because I guess I have a high tolerance for pain.
											(Laughter)
											But the good thing was, once they shoved those rods up there
											and straightened my nose out, I could breathe,
											and I hadn&#39;t been able to breathe
											since I broke my nose in the high school rodeo.&quot;
