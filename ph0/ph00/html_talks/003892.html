											The National Portrait Gallery is the place dedicated
											to presenting great American lives,
											amazing people.
											And that&#39;s what it&#39;s about.
											We use portraiture as a way to deliver those lives, but that&#39;s it.
											And so I&#39;m not going to talk about the painted portrait today.
											I&#39;m going to talk about a program I started there,
											which, from my point of view, is the proudest thing I did.

									<p>
											I started to worry about the fact
											that a lot of people don&#39;t get their portraits painted anymore,
											and they&#39;re amazing people,
											and we want to deliver them to future generations.
											So, how do we do that?
											And so I came up with the idea of the living self-portrait series.
											And the living self-portrait series was the idea of basically
											my being a brush in the hand
											of amazing people who would come and I would interview.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And so what I&#39;m going to do is, not so much give you
											the great hits of that program,
											as to give you this whole notion
											of how you encounter people in that kind of situation,
											what you try to find out about them,
											and when people deliver and when they don&#39;t and why.

									<p>
											Now, I had two preconditions.
											One was that they be American.
											That&#39;s just because, in the nature of the National Portrait Gallery,
											it&#39;s created to look at American lives.
											That was easy, but then I made the decision,
											maybe arbitrary,
											that they needed to be people of a certain age,
											which at that point, when I created this program,
											seemed really old.
											Sixties, seventies, eighties and nineties.
											For obvious reasons, it doesn&#39;t seem that old anymore to me.

								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And why did I do that?
											Well, for one thing, we&#39;re a youth-obsessed culture.
											And I thought really what we need is an elders program
											to just sit at the feet of amazing people and hear them talk.
											But the second part of it — and the older I get,
											the more convinced I am that that&#39;s true.
											It&#39;s amazing what people will say when they know
											how the story turned out.
											That&#39;s the one advantage that older people have.
											Well, they have other, little bit of advantage,
											but they also have some disadvantages,
											but the one thing they or we have is that
											we&#39;ve reached the point in life
											where we know how the story turned out.
											So, we can then go back in our lives,
											if we&#39;ve got an interviewer who gets that,
											and begin to reflect on how we got there.
											All of those accidents that wound up
											creating the life narrative that we inherited.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So, I thought okay, now,
											what is it going to take to make this work?
											There are many kinds of interviews. We know them.
											There are the journalist interviews,
											which are the interrogation that is expected.
											This is somewhat against resistance
											and caginess on the part of the interviewee.
											Then there&#39;s the celebrity interview,
											where it&#39;s more important who&#39;s asking the question than who answers.
											That&#39;s Barbara Walters and others like that, and we like that.
											That&#39;s Frost-Nixon, where Frost seems to be as important
											as Nixon in that process.
											Fair enough.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											But I wanted interviews that were different.
											I wanted to be, as I later thought of it, empathic,
											which is to say, to feel what they wanted to say
											and to be an agent of their self-revelation.
											By the way, this was always done in public.
											This was not an oral history program.
											This was all about 300 people sitting at the feet of this individual,
											and having me be the brush in their self-portrait.
									</p>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now, it turns out that I was pretty good at that.
											I didn&#39;t know it coming into it.
											And the only reason I really know that
											is because of one interview I did with Senator William Fulbright,
											and that was six months after he&#39;d had a stroke.
											And he had never appeared in public since that point.
											This was not a devastating stroke,
											but it did affect his speaking and so forth.
											And I thought it was worth a chance,
											he thought it was worth a chance,
											and so we got up on the stage,
											and we had an hour conversation about his life,
											and after that a woman rushed up to me,
											essentially did,
											and she said, &quot;Where did you train as a doctor?&quot;
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">

											And I said, &quot;I have no training as a doctor. I never claimed that.&quot;

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And she said, &quot;Well, something very weird was happening.
											When he started a sentence, particularly
											in the early parts of the interview,
											and paused, you gave him the word,
											the bridge to get to the end of the sentence,
											and by the end of it,
											he was speaking complete sentences on his own.&quot;
											I didn&#39;t know what was going on,
											but I was so part of the process of getting that out.

									<p>
											So I thought, okay, fine, I&#39;ve got empathy,
											or empathy, at any rate,
											is what&#39;s critical to this kind of interview.
											But then I began to think of other things.
											Who makes a great interview in this context?
											It had nothing to do with their intellect,
											the quality of their intellect.
											Some of them were very brilliant,
											some of them were,
											you know, ordinary people who would never claim to be intellectuals,
											but it was never about that.
											It was about their energy.
											It&#39;s energy that creates extraordinary interviews
											and extraordinary lives.
											I&#39;m convinced of it.
											And it had nothing to do with the energy of being young.
											These were people through their 90s.

									<p>
											In fact, the first person I interviewed
											was George Abbott, who was 97,
											and Abbott was filled with the life force —
											I guess that&#39;s the way I think about it — filled with it.
											And so he filled the room,
											and we had an extraordinary conversation.
											He was supposed to be the toughest interview that anybody would ever do
											because he was famous for being silent,
											for never ever saying anything
											except maybe a word or two.
											And, in fact, he did wind up opening up —
											by the way, his energy is evidenced in other ways.
											He subsequently got married again at 102,
											so he, you know, he had a lot of the life force in him.

											But after the interview, I got a call,
											very gruff voice, from a woman.
											I didn&#39;t know who she was,

											And she said, &quot;I&#39;m his old girlfriend, Maureen Stapleton,

											So, you know, you want energy,
											you want the life force,
											but you really want them also to think
											that they have a story worth sharing.
											The worst interviews that you can ever have
											are with people who are modest.
											Never ever get up on a stage with somebody who&#39;s modest,
											because all of these people have been assembled
											to listen to them, and they sit there and they say,
											&quot;Aw, shucks, it was an accident.&quot;
											There&#39;s nothing that ever happens that justifies
											people taking good hours of the day to be with them.

											The worst interview I ever did: William L. Shirer.
											The journalist who did &quot;The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich.&quot;
											This guy had met Hitler and Gandhi within six months,
											and every time I&#39;d ask him about it, he&#39;d say, &quot;Oh, I just happened to be there.
											Didn&#39;t matter.&quot; Whatever.
											Awful.
											I never would ever agree to interview a modest person.
											They have to think that they did something
											and that they want to share it with you.

											But it comes down, in the end,
											to how do you get through all the barriers we have.
											All of us are public and private beings,
											and if all you&#39;re going to get from the interviewee is their public self,
											there&#39;s no point in it.
											It&#39;s pre-programmed. It&#39;s infomercial,
											and we all have infomercials about our lives.
											We know the great lines, we know the great moments,
											we know what we&#39;re not going to share,
											and the point of this was not to embarrass anybody.
											This wasn&#39;t — and some of you will remember

											There&#39;s an extraordinary woman named Clare Boothe Luce.
											It&#39;ll be your generational determinant
											as to whether her name means much to you.
											She did so much. She was a playwright.
											She did an extraordinary play called &quot;The Women.&quot;
											She was a congresswoman
											when there weren&#39;t very many congresswomen.
											She was editor of Vanity Fair,
											one of the great phenomenal women of her day.
											And, incidentally, I call her
											the Eleanor Roosevelt of the Right.
											She was sort of adored on the Right
											the way Eleanor Roosevelt was on the Left.
											And, in fact, when we did the interview —
											I did the living self-portrait with her —
											there were three former directors of the CIA
											basically sitting at her feet,
											just enjoying her presence.

											I asked her a question about her days as a playwright,

											she said, &quot;Oh, playwright. Everybody knows I was a playwright.
											Most people think that I was an actress. I was never an actress.&quot;

											And he said, &quot;Well, of course,
											but actually, I know him better than anyone who ever met him,
											because I got to read all of his letters.&quot;
											So, he was very satisfied with the kind of relationship they had over 50 years.

											And here is this man who had given his whole life to uncovering Jefferson
											and connecting with him,
											and he said, &quot;Well ...&quot; — I&#39;m going to do a bad southern accent.
											Dumas Malone was from Mississippi originally.
											But he said, &quot;Well,&quot; he said, &quot;I&#39;m afraid so.&quot;
											He said, &quot;You know, I&#39;ve read everything,

											And he basically was saying that this was a man
											who lied more than he wished he had,
											because he saw the letters.
											He said, &quot;But I understand that.&quot; He said, &quot;I understand that.&quot;
											He said, &quot;We southerners do like a smooth surface,

											And he said, &quot;Now, John Adams was too honest.&quot;
											And he started to talk about that, and later on he invited me to his house,
											and I met his wife who was from Massachusetts,
											and he and she had exactly the relationship
											of Thomas Jefferson and John Adams.
											She was the New Englander and abrasive,

											But really the most important question I ever asked,
											and most of the times when I talk about it,
											people kind of suck in their breath at my audacity, or cruelty,
											but I promise you it was the right question.
											This was to Agnes de Mille.
											Agnes de Mille is one of the great choreographers in our history.
											She basically created the dances in &quot;Oklahoma,&quot;
											transforming the American theater.
											An amazing woman.

											At the time that I proposed to her that —
											by the way, I would have proposed to her; she was extraordinary —
											but proposed to her that she come on.
											She said, &quot;Come to my apartment.&quot;
											She lived in New York.
											&quot;Come to my apartment and we&#39;ll talk for those 15 minutes,

											And so I showed up in this dark, rambling New York apartment,
											and she called out to me, and she was in bed.
											I had known that she had had a stroke,
											and that was some 10 years before.
											And so she spent almost all of her life in bed,
											but — I speak of the life force —
											her hair was askew.
											She wasn&#39;t about to make up for this occasion.

											And she was sitting there surrounded by books,
											and her most interesting possession she felt at that moment
											was her will, which she had by her side.
											She wasn&#39;t unhappy about this. She was resigned.
											She said, &quot;I keep this will by my bed, memento mori,
											and I change it all the time
											just because I want to.&quot;
											And she was loving the prospect of death as much as she had loved life.
											I thought, this is somebody I&#39;ve got to get in this series.

											She agreed.
											She came on. Of course she was wheelchaired on.
											Half of her body was stricken, the other half not.
											She was, of course, done up for the occasion,
											but this was a woman in great physical distress.
											And we had a conversation,
											and then I asked her this unthinkable question.
											I said, &quot;Was it a problem for you in your life that you were not beautiful?&quot;

											And the audience just — you know,
											they&#39;re always on the side of the interviewee,
											and they felt that this was a kind of assault,
											but this was the question she had
											wanted somebody to ask her whole life.
											And she began to talk about her childhood, when she was beautiful,
											and she literally turned — here she was, in this broken body —
											and she turned to the audience and
											described herself as the fair demoiselle
											with her red hair and her light steps and so forth,
											and then she said, &quot;And then puberty hit.&quot;

									<p>
											And she began to talk about things that had happened
											to her body and her face,
											and how she could no longer count on her beauty,
											and her family then treated her like the ugly sister of the beautiful one
											for whom all the ballet lessons were given.
											And she had to go along just to be with her sister for company,
											and in that process, she made a number of decisions.
											First of all, was that dance, even though
											it hadn&#39;t been offered to her, was her life.
											And secondly, she had better be,
											although she did dance for a while, a choreographer
											because then her looks didn&#39;t matter.
											But she was thrilled to get that out as a real, real fact in her life.

									<p>
											It was an amazing privilege to do this series.
											There were other moments like that, very few moments of silence.
											The key point was empathy
											because everybody in their lives
											is really waiting for people to ask them questions,
											so that they can be truthful about who they are
											and how they became what they are,
											and I commend that to you, even if you&#39;re not doing interviews.
											Just be that way with your friends
											and particularly the older members of your family.

director, scholar, author, educator and interviewer. He's done it all. In doing so, he's greatly expanded the cultural life of the nation's capital and the country. ","whotheyare":"Marc Pachter has spent his career curating and creating intimate portraits of the lives of others. ","whylisten":"<p>Marc Pachter is a man of many talents, and it seems he&#39;s used every one of them during his 33 years at the Smithsonian Institution. <strong>Although he has devoted most of his career to one organization, with the single goal of capturing the lives of great Americans, to do so he has played multiple roles.</strong> He began his time at the Smithsonian just after a five-year stint at Harvard, where he earned a master&#39;s in history and taught Colonial history.&nbsp; Since that time he has served as acting director of the National Museum of American History, chaired the celebration of the Smithsonian&#39;s 150th anniversary, created the first national portrait competition, organized the first national conference on biography and created an interview program called &quot;Living Self-Portaits&quot; which earned him the title of Smithsonian &quot;master interviewer.&quot; <br /><br /><strong>In his final years at the Smithsonian, Pachter was director of the National Portrait Gallery Director, retiring in 2007 to work on his writing.</strong> Pachter has authored two books, <em><a href=\"http://openlibrary.org/b/OL20737956M/Telling_lives_the_biographer%27s_art\">Telling Lives: The Biographer&#39;s Art</a></em> and <em><a href=\"http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Gallery-of-Presidents/Marc-Pachter/e/9780874747430\">A Gallery of Presidents</a></em>, and is editor of several more. In addition, he holds an editorial role at the peer-reviewed journal <em>Biography</em> and was senior cultural advisor to the United States Information Agency for some years. </p>"}],"speaker_name":"Marc Pachter","tags":["art","history","performance","personal growth","Best of the Web"],"title":"The art of the interview","video_type":{"id":"5","name":"Best of Web"},"viewed_count":864177}]}})</script></div>
