<title>Vivek Maru: How to put the power of law in people&#39;s hands | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: What can you do when the wheels of justice don&#39;t turn fast enough? Or when they don&#39;t turn at all? Vivek Maru is working to transform the relationship between people and law, turning law from an abstraction or threat into something that everyone can understand, use and shape. Instead of relying solely on lawyers, Maru started a global network of community paralegals, or barefoot lawyers, who serve in their own communities and break the law down into simple terms to help people find solutions. Learn more about how this innovative approach to using the law is helping socially excluded people claim their rights. &quot;A little bit of legal empowerment can go a long way,&quot; Maru says." />

<meta content='What can you do when the wheels of justice don&#x0027;t turn fast enough? Or when they don&#x0027;t turn at all? Vivek Maru is working to transform the relationship between people and law, turning law from an abstraction or threat into something that everyone can understand, use and shape. Instead of relying solely on lawyers, Maru started a global network of community paralegals, or barefoot lawyers, who serve in their own communities and break the law down into simple terms to help people find solutions. Learn more about how this innovative approach to using the law is helping socially excluded people claim their rights. "A little bit of legal empowerment can go a long way," Maru says.' itemprop='description'>

											Ravi&#39;s from a community
of herdspeople in Gujarat
											on the western coast of India,
											same place my own family comes from.
											When he was 10 years old,
his entire community was forced to move
											because a multinational corporation
											constructed a manufacturing facility
on the land where they lived.
											Then, 20 years later,
the same company built a cement factory
											100 meters from where they live now.
											India has got strong
environmental regulations on paper,
											but this company
has violated many of them.
											Dust from that factory
covers Ravi&#39;s mustache
											and everything he wears.
											I spent just two days in his place,
and I coughed for a week.
											Ravi says that if people or animals
eat anything that grows in his village
											or drink the water,
											they get sick.
											He says children now walk
long distances with cattle and buffalo
											to find uncontaminated grazing land.
											He says many of those kids
have dropped out of school,
											including three of his own.

											We are living with a global

											into putting their thumbprints

they&#39;ve ever known for a pittance

are raising their children

their air and their water.
											There are environmental laws

											But grandma&#39;s right, in a way.
											Something about law

											We lawyers are usually
expensive, first of all,

on formal court channels
											that are impractical

											Worse, our profession has shrouded law
in a cloak of complexity.

											If we&#39;re going to make justice
a reality for everyone,
											we need to turn law
from an abstraction or a threat
											into something that every single person
can understand, use and shape.
											Lawyers are crucial
in that fight, no doubt,
											but we can&#39;t leave it to lawyers alone.
											In health care, for example,
											we don&#39;t just rely
on doctors to serve patients.
											We have nurses and midwives
and community health workers.
											The same should be true of justice.
											Community legal workers,
											sometimes we call them
community paralegals,
											or barefoot lawyers,
											can be a bridge.
											These paralegals are from
the communities they serve.
											They demystify law,
											break it down into simple terms,
											and then they help people
look for a solution.
											They don&#39;t focus on the courts alone.
											They look everywhere:
											ministry departments,
local government, an ombudsman&#39;s office.
											Lawyers sometimes say to their clients,
											&quot;I&#39;ll handle it for you. I&#39;ve got you.&quot;
											Paralegals have a different message,
											not &quot;I&#39;m going to solve it for you,&quot;
											but &quot;We&#39;re going to solve it together,
											and in the process,
we&#39;re both going to grow.&quot;

											Community paralegals
saved my own relationship to law.

											Then, two years later, he met someone.
											I&#39;m going to call him Kush.
											Kush is part of a team
of community paralegals
											that works for environmental justice
on the Gujarat coast.
											Kush explained to Ravi
that there was law on his side.
											Kush translated into Gujarati
something Ravi had never seen.
											It&#39;s called the &quot;consent to operate.&quot;
											It&#39;s issued by the state government,
											and it allows the factory to run
											only if it complies
with specific conditions.
											So together, they compared
the legal requirements with reality,
											they collected evidence,
											and they drafted an application —
											not to the courts,
but to two administrative institutions,
											the Pollution Control Board
and the district administration.
											Those applications started turning
the creaky wheels of enforcement.
											A pollution officer
came for a site inspection,
											and after that, the company
started running an air filtration system
											it was supposed to have
been using all along.
											It also started covering the 100 trucks
											that come and go
from that plant every day.
											Those two measures
reduced the air pollution considerably.
											The case is far from over,
											but learning and using law gave Ravi hope.

											Let me give you another example.
											This is Khadija Hamsa.
											She is one of five million people in Kenya
who faces a discriminatory vetting process
											when trying to obtain a national ID card.
											It is like the Jim Crow South
in the United States.
											If you are from a certain set of tribes,
											most of them Muslim,
											you get sent to a different line.
											Without an ID, you can&#39;t apply for a job.
											You can&#39;t get a bank loan.
											You can&#39;t enroll in university.
											You are excluded from society.
											Khadija tried off and on to get an ID
for eight years, without success.
											Then she met a paralegal
working in her community
											named Hassan Kassim.
											Hassan explained to Khadija
how vetting works,
											he helped her gather
the documents she needed,
											helped prep her to go before
the vetting committee.
											Finally, she was able to get an ID
with Hassan&#39;s help.
											First thing she did with it
											was use it to apply
for birth certificates for her children,
											which they need in order to go to school.

											In the United States,
among many other problems,

											In New York, a new crew of paralegals —

Access to Justice Navigators —
											helps people to understand housing law
and to advocate for themselves.
											Normally in New York,
											one out of nine tenants
brought to housing court

is working in practice.
											When you put those stories together,

											People can use that information

											In India, paralegals and clients

											Vivek Maru: Yeah. Anybody remember
the Millennium Development Goals?
											They were adopted in 2000 by the UN
and governments around the world,
											and they were for essential,
laudable things.
											It was reduce child mortality
by two thirds, cut hunger in half,
											crucial things.
											But there was no mention
of justice or fairness
											or accountability or corruption,
											and we have made progress
during the 15 years
											when those goals were in effect,
											but we are way behind
what justice demands,
											and we&#39;re not going to get there
unless we take justice into account.
											And so when the debate started
about the next development framework,
											the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals,
											our community came together
around the world
											to argue that access to justice
and legal empowerment
											should be a part of that new framework.
											And there was a lot of resistance.
											Those things are more political,
more contentious than the other ones,
											so we didn&#39;t know until the night before
whether it was going to come through.
											We squeaked by.
											The 16th out of 17 goals
commits to access to justice for all,
											which is a big deal.
											It&#39;s a big deal, yes.

from the Gates Foundation

											25 billion in public-private financing

											VM: Great question. Thank you for asking.
											I would say three things.
											One is invest.
											If you have 10 dollars,
or a hundred dollars, a million dollars,
											consider putting some of it
towards grassroots legal empowerment.
											It&#39;s important in its own right
											and it&#39;s crucial for just about
everything else we care about.

											Number two,
											push your politicians and your governments
to make this a public priority.
											Just like health or education,
access to justice
											should be one of the things
that a government owes its people,
											and we&#39;re nowhere close to that,
											neither in rich countries
or poor countries.
											Number three is:
be a paralegal in your own life.
											Find an injustice
or a problem where you live.
											It&#39;s not hard to find, if you look.
											Is the river being contaminated,
											the one that passes through
the city where you live?
											Are there workers getting paid
less than minimum wage
											or who are working without safety gear?
											Get to know the people most affected,
											find out what the rules say,
											see if you can use those rules
to get a solution.
											If it doesn&#39;t work, see if you can
come together to improve those rules.
											Because if we all start knowing law,
using law and shaping law,
											then we will be building
that deeper version of democracy
											that I believe our world
desperately needs.

The advocates have worked with more than 65,000 people to protect community lands, enforce environmental law and secure basic rights to healthcare and citizenship. Namati convenes the <a href=\"https://namati.org/network/\" target=\"_blank\">Global Legal Empowerment Network</a>, more than 1,000 groups from 150 countries who are learning from one another and collaborating on common challenges.

Vivek Maru founded <a href=\"https://namati.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Namati</a> in 2011 to grow the movement for legal empowerment, building cadres of grassroots legal advocates, also known as &quot;community paralegals,&quot; in ten countries so far. The advocates have worked with more than 65,000 people to protect community lands, enforce environmental law and secure basic rights to healthcare and citizenship. Namati convenes the <a href=\"https://namati.org/network/\" target=\"_blank\">Global Legal Empowerment Network</a>, more than 1,000 groups from 150 countries who are learning from one another and collaborating on common challenges. Thanks to their work, access to justice is part of the UN&#39;s new global development framework, the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals.</p><p>From 2003 to 2007, Maru co-founded and co-directed the Sierra Leonean organization Timap for Justice, a pioneering model for delivering justice services in the context of a weak state and a plural legal system. From 2008 to 2011, he served as senior counsel in the Justice Reform Group of the World Bank. His work focused on rule of law reform and governance, primarily in West Africa and South Asia. In 1997&ndash;1998 he lived in a hut of dung and sticks in a village in Kutch, his native place, in western India, working on watershed management and girls&#39; education with two grassroots development organizations, Kutch Mahila Vikas Sanghathan and Sahjeevan.</p>"}],"speaker_name":"Vivek Maru","tags":["communication","global issues","community","activism","innovation","inequality","law","social change","society","justice system"],"title":"How to put the power of law in people's hands","video_type":{"id":"1","name":"TED Stage Talk"},"viewed_count":1228077}]}})</script></div>
