											When we think about prejudice and bias,
											we tend to think about stupid and evil people
											doing stupid and evil things.
											And this idea is nicely summarized
											by the British critic William Hazlitt,
											who wrote, &quot;Prejudice is the child of ignorance.&quot;
											I want to try to convince you here
											that this is mistaken.
											I want to try to convince you
											that prejudice and bias
											are natural, they&#39;re often rational,
											and they&#39;re often even moral,
											and I think that once we understand this,
											we&#39;re in a better position to make sense of them
											when they go wrong,
											when they have horrible consequences,
											and we&#39;re in a better position to know what to do
											when this happens.

											So, start with stereotypes. You look at me,
											you know my name, you
know certain facts about me,
											and you could make certain judgments.
											You could make guesses about my ethnicity,
											my political affiliation, my religious beliefs.
											And the thing is, these
judgments tend to be accurate.
											We&#39;re very good at this sort of thing.
											And we&#39;re very good at this sort of thing
											because our ability to stereotype people
											is not some sort of arbitrary quirk of the mind,
											but rather it&#39;s a specific instance
											of a more general process,
											which is that we have experience
											with things and people in the world
											that fall into categories,
											and we can use our experience
to make generalizations
											about novel instances of these categories.
											So everybody here has a lot of experience
											with chairs and apples and dogs,
											and based on this, you could see
											unfamiliar examples and you could guess,
											you could sit on the chair,
											you could eat the apple, the dog will bark.
											Now we might be wrong.
											The chair could collapse if you sit on it,
											the apple might be poison, the dog might not bark,
											and in fact, this is my dog Tessie, who doesn&#39;t bark.
											But for the most part, we&#39;re good at this.
											For the most part, we make good guesses
											both in the social domain and the non-social domain,
											and if we weren&#39;t able to do so,
											if we weren&#39;t able to make guesses about
new instances that we encounter,
											we wouldn&#39;t survive.
											And in fact, Hazlitt later on in his wonderful essay
											concedes this.
											He writes, &quot;Without the aid of prejudice and custom,
											I should not be able to find
my way my across the room;
											nor know how to conduct
myself in any circumstances,
											nor what to feel in any relation of life.&quot;
											Or take bias.
											Now sometimes, we break the world up into
											us versus them, into in-group versus out-group,
											and sometimes when we do this,
											we know we&#39;re doing something wrong,
											and we&#39;re kind of ashamed of it.
											But other times we&#39;re proud of it.
											We openly acknowledge it.
											And my favorite example of this
											is a question that came from the audience
											in a Republican debate prior to the last election.

											Paul Bloom: Each of the people onstage
											agreed with the premise of her question,

											And in fact, in general, people are often swayed
											by feelings of solidarity, loyalty, pride, patriotism,

											Regardless of your politics, many
people feel proud to be American,
											and they favor Americans over other countries.
											Residents of other countries

											Now, this distinction is natural enough
											and often moral enough, but it can go awry,
											and this was part of the research
											of the great social psychologist Henri Tajfel.
											Tajfel was born in Poland in 1919.
											He left to go to university in France,
											because as a Jew, he couldn&#39;t
go to university in Poland,
											and then he enlisted in the French military
											in World War II.
											He was captured and ended up
											in a prisoner of war camp,
											and it was a terrifying time for him,
											because if it was discovered that he was a Jew,
											he could have been moved to a concentration camp,
											where he most likely would not have survived.
											And in fact, when the war
ended and he was released,
											most of his friends and family were dead.
											He got involved in different pursuits.
											He helped out the war orphans.
											But he had a long-lasting interest
											in the science of prejudice,
											and so when a prestigious British scholarship
											on stereotypes opened up, he applied for it,
											and he won it,
											and then he began this amazing career.
											And what started his career is an insight
											that the way most people were thinking
											about the Holocaust was wrong.
											Many people, most people at the time,
											viewed the Holocaust as sort of representing
											some tragic flaw on the part of the Germans,
											some genetic taint, some authoritarian personality.
											And Tajfel rejected this.
											Tajfel said what we see in the Holocaust
											is just an exaggeration
											of normal psychological processes
											that exist in every one of us.
											And to explore this, he did a series of classic studies
											with British adolescents.
											And in one of his studies, what he did was he asked
											the British adolescents all sorts of questions,
											and then based on their answers, he said,
											&quot;I&#39;ve looked at your answers,
and based on the answers,
											I have determined that you are either&quot; —
											he told half of them —
											&quot;a Kandinsky lover, you love the work of Kandinsky,
											or a Klee lover, you love the work of Klee.&quot;
											It was entirely bogus.
											Their answers had nothing
to do with Kandinsky or Klee.
											They probably hadn&#39;t heard of the artists.
											He just arbitrarily divided them up.
											But what he found was, these categories mattered,
											so when he later gave the subjects money,
											they would prefer to give the money
											to members of their own group
											than members of the other group.
											Worse, they were actually most interested
											in establishing a difference
											between their group and other groups,
											so they would give up money for their own group
											if by doing so they could give
the other group even less.

											This bias seems to show up very early.
											So my colleague and wife, Karen Wynn, at Yale
											has done a series of studies with babies
											where she exposes babies to puppets,
											and the puppets have certain food preferences.
											So one of the puppets might like green beans.
											The other puppet might like graham crackers.
											They test the babies own food preferences,
											and babies typically prefer the graham crackers.
											But the question is, does this matter to babies
											in how they treat the puppets? And it matters a lot.
											They tend to prefer the puppet
											who has the same food tastes that they have,
											and worse, they actually prefer puppets
											who punish the puppet with the different food taste.

											We see this sort of in-group,
out-group psychology all the time.
											We see it in political clashes
											within groups with different ideologies.
											We see it in its extreme in cases of war,
											where the out-group isn&#39;t merely given less,
											but dehumanized,
											as in the Nazi perspective of Jews
											as vermin or lice,
											or the American perspective of Japanese as rats.

											Stereotypes can also go awry.
											So often they&#39;re rational and useful,
											but sometimes they&#39;re irrational,
											they give the wrong answers,
											and other times
											they lead to plainly immoral consequences.
											And the case that&#39;s been most studied
											is the case of race.
											There was a fascinating study
											prior to the 2008 election
											where social psychologists looked at the extent
											to which the candidates were
associated with America,
											as in an unconscious association
with the American flag.
											And in one of their studies they compared
											Obama and McCain, and they found McCain
											is thought of as more American than Obama,
											and to some extent, people aren&#39;t 
that surprised by hearing that.
											McCain is a celebrated war hero,
											and many people would explicitly say
											he has more of an American story than Obama.
											But they also compared Obama
											to British Prime Minister Tony Blair,
											and they found that Blair was also thought of
											as more American than Obama,
											even though subjects explicitly understood
											that he&#39;s not American at all.
											But they were responding, of course,
											to the color of his skin.

											These stereotypes and biases
											have real-world consequences,
											both subtle and very important.
											In one recent study, researchers
											put ads on eBay for the sale of baseball cards.
											Some of them were held by white hands,
											others by black hands.
											They were the same baseball cards.
											The ones held by black hands
											got substantially smaller bids
											than the ones held by white hands.
											In research done at Stanford,
											psychologists explored the case of people
											sentenced for the murder of a white person.
											It turns out, holding everything else constant,
											you are considerably more likely to be executed
											if you look like the man on the right
											than the man on the left,
											and this is in large part because
											the man on the right looks more prototypically black,
											more prototypically African-American,
											and this apparently influences people&#39;s decisions
											over what to do about him.

											So now that we know about this,
											how do we combat it?
											And there are different avenues.
											One avenue is to appeal
											to people&#39;s emotional responses,
											to appeal to people&#39;s empathy,
											and we often do that through stories.
											So if you are a liberal parent
											and you want to encourage your children
											to believe in the merits of nontraditional families,
											you might give them a book like this.
[&quot;Heather Has Two Mommies&quot;]
											If you are conservative and have a different attitude,
											you might give them a book like this.
											(Laughter)
[&quot;Help! Mom! There Are Liberals under My Bed!&quot;]
											But in general, stories can turn
											anonymous strangers into people who matter,
											and the idea that we care about people
											when we focus on them as individuals
											is an idea which has shown up across history.
											So Stalin apocryphally said,
											&quot;A single death is a tragedy,
											a million deaths is a statistic,&quot;
											and Mother Teresa said,
											&quot;If I look at the mass, I will never act.
											If I look at the one, I will.&quot;
											Psychologists have explored this.
											For instance, in one study,
											people were given a list of facts about a crisis,
											and it was seen how much they would donate
											to solve this crisis,
											and another group was given no facts at all
											but they were told of an individual
											and given a name and given a face,
											and it turns out that they gave far more.
											None of this I think is a secret
											to the people who are engaged in charity work.
											People don&#39;t tend to deluge people
											with facts and statistics.
											Rather, you show them faces,
											you show them people.
											It&#39;s possible that by extending our sympathies
											to an individual, they can spread
											to the group that the individual belongs to.

											This is Harriet Beecher Stowe.

											and said to her,

											And he was talking about &quot;Uncle Tom&#39;s Cabin.&quot;
											&quot;Uncle Tom&#39;s Cabin&quot; is not

											But it&#39;s not all emotions,

											What they&#39;re grounded in is the
understanding of human rights,
											a belief that their life is as valuable to them
											as my life is to me,
											and to support this, he tells a story
											by the great philosopher Adam Smith,

											So Adam Smith starts by asking you to imagine
											the death of thousands of people,
											and imagine that the thousands of people
											are in a country you are not familiar with.
											It could be China or India or a country in Africa.
											And Smith says, how would you respond?
											And you would say, well that&#39;s too bad,
											and you&#39;d go on to the rest of your life.
											If you were to open up The New
York Times online or something,
											and discover this, and in fact
this happens to us all the time,
											we go about our lives.
											But imagine instead, Smith says,
											you were to learn that tomorrow
											you were to have your little finger chopped off.
											Smith says, that would matter a lot.
											You would not sleep that night
											wondering about that.
											So this raises the question:
											Would you sacrifice thousands of lives
											to save your little finger?
											Now answer this in the privacy of your own head,
											but Smith says, absolutely not,
											what a horrid thought.
											And so this raises the question,
											and so, as Smith puts it,
											&quot;When our passive feelings are almost always
											so sordid and so selfish,
											how comes it that our active principles
											should often be so generous and so noble?&quot;
											And Smith&#39;s answer is, &quot;It is reason,
											principle, conscience.
											[This] calls to us,
											with a voice capable of astonishing
the most presumptuous of our passions,
											that we are but one of the multitude,
