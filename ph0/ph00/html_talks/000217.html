											This session is on natural wonders,
											and the bigger conference is on the pursuit of happiness.
											I want to try to combine them all,
											because to me, healing is really the ultimate natural wonder.
											Your body has a remarkable capacity to begin healing itself,
											and much more quickly than people had once realized,
											if you simply stop doing what’s causing the problem.
											And so, really, so much of what we do in medicine and life in general
											is focused on mopping up the floor without also turning off the faucet.

											I love doing this work, because it really gives many people
											new hope and new choices that they didn’t have before,
											and it allows us to talk about things that — not just diet,
											but that happiness is not —
											we&#39;re talking about the pursuit of happiness,
											but when you really look at all the spiritual traditions,
											what Aldous Huxley called the &quot;perennial wisdom,&quot;
											when you get past the named and forms and rituals that really divide people,
											it’s really about — our nature is to be happy;
											our nature is to be peaceful, our nature is to be healthy.
											And so it’s not something — happiness is not something you get,
											health is generally not something that you get.
											But rather all of these different practices —
											you know, the ancient swamis and rabbis and priests and monks and nuns
											didn’t develop these techniques to just manage stress
											or lower your blood pressure, unclog your arteries,
											even though it can do all those things.
											They’re powerful tools for transformation,
											for quieting down our mind and bodies
											to allow us to experience what it feels like to be happy,
											to be peaceful, to be joyful
											and to realize that it’s not something that you pursue and get,
											but rather it’s something that you have already until you disturb it.

											Now, there’s no mystery in how you lose weight;
											you either burn more calories by exercise or you eat fewer calories.
											Now, one way to eat fewer calories is to eat less food,
											which is why you can lose weight on any diet if you eat less food,
											or if you restrict entire categories of foods.
											But the problem is, you get hungry, so it’s hard to keep it off.
											The other way is to change the type of food.
											And fat has nine calories per gram,
											whereas protein and carbs only have four.
											So, when you eat less fat, you eat fewer calories without having to eat less food.
											So you can eat the same amount of food, but you’ll be getting fewer calories
											because the food is less dense in calories.

											You know, I don’t like talking about the Atkins diet, but I get asked about it every day,
											and so I just thought I’d spend a few minutes on that.
											The myth that you hear about is,
											Americans have been told to eat less fat,
											the percent of calories from fat is down,
											Americans are fatter than ever, therefore fat doesn’t make you fat.
											It’s a half-truth. Actually, Americans are eating more fat than ever,
											and even more carbs. And so the percentage is lower,
											the actual amount is higher, and so the goal is to reduce both.
											Dr. Atkins and I debated each other many times before he died,
											and we agreed that Americans eat too many simple carbs,
											the &quot;bad carbs,&quot; and these are things like —
											(Laughter)
											— sugar, white flour, white rice, alcohol. And you get a double whammy:
											you get all these calories that don’t fill you up because you’ve removed the fiber,
											and they get absorbed quickly so your blood sugar zooms up.
											Your pancreas makes insulin to bring it back down, which is good.
											But insulin accelerates the conversion of calories into fat.
											So, the goal is not to go to pork rinds and bacon and sausages —
											these are not health foods —
											but to go from &quot;bad carbs&quot; to what are called &quot;good carbs.&quot;
											And these are things like whole foods, or unrefined carbs:
											fruits, vegetables, whole wheat flour, brown rice, in their natural forms, are rich in fiber.
											And the fiber fills you up before you get too many calories,
											and it slows the absorption so you don’t get that rapid rise in blood sugar.
											So, and you get all the disease-protective substances.

											It’s not just what you exclude from your diet,
											but also what you include that’s protective.
											Just as all carbs are not bad for you, all fats are not bad for you. There are good fats.
											And these are predominantly what are called the Omega-3 fatty acids.
											You find these, for example, in fish oil.
											And the bad fats are things like trans-fatty acids and processed food
											and saturated fats, which we find in meat.
											If you don’t remember anything else from this talk,
											three grams a day of fish oil can reduce your risk of a heart attack
											and sudden death by 50 to 80 percent.
											Three grams a day. They come in one-gram capsules;
											more than that just gives you extra fat you don’t need.
											It also helps reduce the risk of the most common cancers
											like breast, prostate and colon cancer.
											Now, the problem with the Atkins diet,
											everybody knows people who have lost weight on it,
											but you can lose weight on amphetamines, you know, and fen-phen.
											I mean, there are lots of ways of losing weight that aren’t good for you.
											You want to lose weight in a way that enhances your health
											rather than the one that harms it.
											And the problem is that it’s based on this half-truth,
											which is that Americans eat too many simple carbs,
											so if you eat fewer simple carbs you’re going to lose weight.
											You’ll lose even more weight if you go to whole foods and less fat,
											and you’ll enhance your health rather than harming it.

											I then wondered, well, maybe they’re just changing their PSA,
											but it’s not really affecting the tumor growth.
											So we took some of their blood serum and sent it down to UCLA;
											they added it to a standard line of prostate tumor cells growing in tissue culture,
											and it inhibited the growth seven times more
											in the experimental group than in the control group — 70 versus 9 percent.
											And finally, I said, I wonder if there’s any relationship between
											how much people change and how it inhibited their tumor growth,
											whichever group they happened to be in.
											And this really got me excited because again,
											we found the same pattern: the more people change,
											the more it affected the growth of their tumors.
											And finally, we did MRI and MR spectroscopy scans on some of these patients,
											and the tumor activity is shown in red in this patient,
											and you can see clearly it’s better a year later, along with the PSA going down.
											So, if it’s true for prostate cancer, it’ll almost certainly be true for breast cancer as well.
											And whether or not you have conventional treatment,
											in addition, if you make these changes, it may help reduce the risk of recurrence.

											He took women with metastatic breast cancer,
											randomly divided them into two groups.
											One group of people just met for an hour-and-a-half once a week in a support group.
											It was a nurturing, loving environment,
											where they were encouraged to let down their emotional defenses
											and talk about how awful it is to have breast cancer
											with people who understood, because they were going through it too.
											They just met once a week for a year.
											Five years later, those women lived twice as long, and you can see that the people —
											and that was the only difference between the groups.
											It was a randomized control study published in The Lancet.
											Other studies have shown this as well.
											So, these simple things that create intimacy are really healing,
											and even the word healing, it comes from the root &quot;to make whole.&quot;
											The word yoga comes from the Sanskrit,
											meaning &quot;union, to yoke, to bring together.&quot;

											And the last slide I want to show you is from — I was — again,
											this swami that I studied with for so many years, and I
											did a combined oncology and cardiology Grand Rounds
											at the University of Virginia medical school a couple of years ago.
											And at the end of it, somebody said,
											&quot;Hey, Swami, what’s the difference between wellness and illness?&quot;
											And so he went up on the board and he wrote the word &quot;illness,&quot;
											and circled the first letter, and then wrote the word &quot;wellness,&quot;
											and circled the first two letters ...
											To me, it’s just shorthand for what we’re talking about:
											that anything that creates a sense of connection
											and community and love is really healing.
											And then we can enjoy our lives more fully without getting sick in the process.
											Thank you. (Applause)
