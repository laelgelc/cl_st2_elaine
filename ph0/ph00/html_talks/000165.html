											But of course what we have to remember is this.
											And what you have to think about is,
											when you&#39;re dancing in the flames, what&#39;s next?
											So what I&#39;m going to try to do in the next 17 and a half minutes

											where we are in the economy —
											and then I&#39;m going to take three trends

											But anyway, let&#39;s start with the economy.
											There&#39;s a couple of really big problems that are still sitting there.
											One is leverage.
											And the problem with leverage is
											it makes the U.S. financial system look like this.

									<p>
											So, a normal commercial bank has nine to 10 times leverage.
											That means for every dollar you deposit, it loans out about nine or 10.
											A normal investment bank is not a deposit bank,
											it&#39;s an investment bank;
											it has 15 to 20 times.
											It turns out that B of A in September had 32 times.
											And your friendly Citibank had 47 times.
											Oops.
											That means every bad loan goes bad 47 times over.
											And that, of course, is the reason why all of you
											are making such generous and wonderful donations
											to these nice folks.
											And as you think about that,
											you&#39;ve got to wonder: so what do banks have in store for you now?

											The government, meanwhile, has been acting like Santa Claus.
											We all love Santa Claus, right?
											But the problem with Santa Clause is,
											if you look at the mandatory spending of what these folks have been doing
											and promising folks,
											it turned out that in 1967, 38 percent was mandatory spending
											on what we call &quot;entitlements.&quot;
											And then by 2007 it was 68 percent.
											And we weren&#39;t supposed to run into 100 percent until about 2030.
											Except we&#39;ve been so busy giving away a trillion here, a trillion there,
											that we&#39;ve brought that date of reckoning forward

											to about 2017.
											And we thought we were going to be able to lay these debts off on our kids,
											but, guess what?
											We&#39;re going to start to pay them.
											And the problem with this stuff is, now that the bill&#39;s come due,
											it turns out Santa isn&#39;t quite as cute when it&#39;s summertime.

											Let me show you what it looks like.
											I think I can safely say
											that I&#39;m the only trillionaire in this room.
											This is an actual bill.
											And it&#39;s 10 triliion dollars.
											The only problem with this bill is it&#39;s not really worth very much.
											That was eight bucks last week, four bucks this week,
											a buck next week.
											And that&#39;s what happens to currencies when you don&#39;t stand behind them.

											you&#39;ve just got to say no.
											And you&#39;ve got to start banishing a word that&#39;s called &quot;entitlement.&quot;
											And the reason we have to do that in the short term
											is because we have just run out of cash.

											If you look at the federal budget, this is what it looks like.
											The orange slice is what&#39;s discretionary.
											Everything else is mandated.
											It makes no difference if we cut out the bridges to Alaska in the overall scheme of things.
											So what we have to start thinking about doing
											is capping our medical spending
											because that&#39;s a monster that&#39;s simply going to eat the entire budget.
											We&#39;ve got to start thinking about asking people
											to retire a little bit later.
											If you&#39;re 60 to 65 you retire on time.
											Your 401(k) just got nailed.
											If you&#39;re 50 to 60 we want you to work two years more.
											If you&#39;re under 50 we want you to work four more years.
											The reason why that&#39;s reasonable is,
											when your grandparents were given Social Security,
											they got it at 65 and were expected to check out at 68.
											Sixty-eight is young today.
											We&#39;ve also got to cut the military about three percent a year.

											Here&#39;s what happens if you don&#39;t address this stuff.
											So, Japan had a fiscal real estate crisis
											back in the late &#39;80s.
											And its 225 largest companies today
											are worth one quarter of what they were 18 years ago.
											We don&#39;t fix this now,

											Now, right behind the financial crisis there&#39;s a second and bigger wave
											that we need to talk about.
											That wave is much larger, much more powerful,
											and that&#39;s of course the wave of technology.
											And what&#39;s really important in this stuff is,
											as we cut, we also have to grow.
											Among other things, because startup companies
											are .02 percent of U.S. GDP investmentm
											and they&#39;re about 17.8 percent of output.
											It&#39;s groups like that in this room that generate the future of the U.S. economy.
											And that&#39;s what we&#39;ve got to keep growing.
											We don&#39;t have to keep growing these bridges to nowhere.
											So let&#39;s bring a romance novelist into this conversation.

											That&#39;s where the ability to engineer microbes,
											the ability to engineer tissues,

											Craig Venter showed up last year

											In parallel, the folks at MIT
											have been building a standard registry of biological parts.
											So think of it as a Radio Shack for biology.
											You can go out and get your proteins, your RNA, your DNA, whatever.
											And start building stuff.

											Here was one of the first things they built.
											So, cells have this cycle.
											First they don&#39;t grow.
											Then they grow exponentially.
											Then they stop growing.
											Graduate students wanted a way of telling which stage they were in.
											So they engineered these cells
											so that when they&#39;re growing in the exponential phase,
											they would smell like wintergreen.
											And when they stopped growing they would smell like bananas.
											And you could tell very easily when your experiment was working

											And we can do it with other things.

											they&#39;ll be able to see in infrared, they&#39;ll be able to focus their eyes,
											they&#39;ll be able to come into a microfocus.
											They&#39;ll do stuff you and I can&#39;t do.
											All of these things are coming together,
											and it&#39;s a particularly important thing to understand,
											as we worry about the flames of the present,
											to keep an eye on the future.

											And, of course, the future is looking back 200 years,
											because next week is the 200th anniversary of Darwin&#39;s birth.
											And it&#39;s the 150th anniversary of the publication of &quot;The Origin of Species.&quot;
											And Darwin, of course, argued that evolution is a natural state.
											It is a natural state in everything that is alive, including hominids.
											There have actually been 22 species of hominids
											that have been around, have evolved, have wandered in different places,
											have gone extinct.
											It is common for hominids to evolve.
											And that&#39;s the reason why, as you look at the hominid fossil record,
											erectus, and heidelbergensis, and floresiensis, and Neanderthals,
											and Homo sapiens, all overlap.
											The common state of affairs is to have overlapping versions of hominids,
											not one.

									<p>
											And as you think of the implications of that,
											here&#39;s a brief history of the universe.
											The universe was created 13.7 billion years ago,
											and then you created all the stars, and all the planets,
											and all the galaxies, and all the Milky Ways.
											And then you created Earth about 4.5 billion years ago,
											and then you got life about four billion years ago,
											and then you got hominids about 0.006 billion years ago,
											and then you got our version of hominids about 0.0015 billion years ago.
											Ta-dah!
											Maybe the reason for thr creation of the universe,
											and all the galaxies, and all the planets, and all the energy,
											and all the dark energy, and all the rest of stuff
											is to create what&#39;s in this room.
											Maybe not.
											That would be a mildly arrogant viewpoint.
											(Laughter)
											So, if that&#39;s not the purpose of the universe, then what&#39;s next?
											(Laughter)

									<p>
											I think what we&#39;re going to see is we&#39;re going to see a different species of hominid.
											I think we&#39;re going to move from a Homo sapiens into a Homo evolutis.
											And I think this isn&#39;t 1,000 years out.
											I think most of us are going to glance at it,
											and our grandchildren are going to begin to live it.
											And a Homo evolutis brings together these three trends
											into a hominid that takes direct and deliberate control
											over the evolution of his species, her species and other species.
											And that, of course, would be the ultimate reboot.
