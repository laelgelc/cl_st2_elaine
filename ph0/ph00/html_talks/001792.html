											&quot;Mom, who are these people?&quot;
											It was an innocent question
from my young daughter Alia
											around the time when she was three.
											We were walking along with my husband
											in one of Abu Dhabi&#39;s big fancy malls.
											Alia was peering at a huge poster
standing tall in the middle of the mall.
											It featured the three rulers
of the United Arab Emirates.
											As she tucked in my side,
											I bent down and explained
that these were the rulers of the UAE
											who had worked hard
to develop their nation
											and preserve its unity.
											She asked, &quot;Mom, why is it
that here where we live,
											and back in Lebanon,
where grandma and grandpa live,
											we never see the pictures
of powerful women on the walls?
											Is it because women are not important?&quot;

									<p>
											This is probably the hardest question
I&#39;ve had to answer in my years as a parent
											and in my 16-plus years
of professional life, for that matter.
											I had grown up in my hometown in Lebanon,
											the younger of two daughters
to a very hard-working pilot
											and director of operations
for the Lebanese Airlines
											and a super-supportive
stay-at-home mom and grandma.
											My father had encouraged
my sister and I to pursue our education
											even though our culture
emphasized at the time
											that it was sons and not daughters
who should be professionally motivated.
											I was one of very few girls
of my generation
											who left home at 18 to study abroad.
											My father didn&#39;t have a son,
											and so I, in a sense, became his.

									<p>
											Fast-forward a couple of decades,
and I hope I didn&#39;t do too badly
											in making my father proud
of his would-be son.
											As I got my Bachelor&#39;s and PhD
in electrical engineering,
											did R and D in the UK,
then consulting in the Middle East,
											I have always been
in male-dominated environments.
											Truth be told, I have never found
a role model I could truly identify with.
											My mother&#39;s generation
wasn&#39;t into professional leadership.
											There were some
encouraging men along the way,
											but none knew the demands
and pressures I was facing,
											pressures that got particularly acute
when I had my own two beautiful children.
											And although Western women love to give us
poor, oppressed Arab women advice,
											they live different lives
with different constraints.

									<p>
											So Arab women of my generation
have had to become our own role models.
											We have had to juggle more than Arab men,
											and we have had to face
more cultural rigidity than Western women.
											As a result, I would like to think
that we poor, oppressed women
											actually have some useful,
certainly hard-earned lessons to share,
											lessons that might turn out useful
											for anyone wishing to thrive
in the modern world.
											Here are three of mine.

											In my previous job,
well before my current firm,
											I was working with a man
we will call John.
											I had teamed up with John
and was working hard,
											hoping he would notice how great I was
											and that he would come to support
my case to make partner at the firm.
											I was, in addition to delivering
on my consulting projects,
											writing passionately on the topic
of women economic empowerment.
											One day, I got to present my research
to a roomful of MBA students.
											John was part of the audience
											listening for the first time
to the details of my study.
											As I proceeded with my presentation,
											I could see John in the corner of my eye.
											He had turned a dark shade of pink
											and had slid under his chair
in apparent shame.

to an applauding audience

											There he exploded.
											&quot;What you did up there was unacceptable!
											You are a consultant, not an activist!&quot;
											I said, &quot;John, I don&#39;t understand.
											I presented a couple of
gender parity indices,
											and some conclusions about the Arab world.
											Yes, we do happen to be today
at the bottom of the index,

that was not factual?&quot;

&quot;The whole premise of your study is wrong.
											What you are doing is dangerous and will

their place is in the home.&quot;

											Time stood still for a long while,
											and all I could think and repeat
in the chaos of my brain was:
											&quot;You can forget about
that partnership, Leila.
											It&#39;s just never going to happen.&quot;
											It took me a couple of days to fully
absorb this incident and its implications,
											but once I did,
I reached three conclusions.
											One, that these were his issues,
											his complexes.
											There may be many like him in our society,

											I got one, by the way,
and boy, was he great.

what women with children can do.
											I apply this lesson equally well
to my personal life.
											As I have progressed in my career,
											I have received many words
of encouragement,
											but I have also often been met
by women, men and couples
											who have clearly had an issue
with my husband and I

precious thing to me,

failing them in any way is intolerable.

											Some women in the Middle East
											are lucky enough to be married
to someone supportive of their career.
											Correction: I should say &quot;smart enough,&quot;
											because who you marry is your own choice,
											and you&#39;d better marry someone supportive
if you plan to have a long career.
											Still today, the Arab man
is not an equal contributor in the home.
											It&#39;s simply not expected by our society,
											and even frowned upon as not very manly.
											As for the Arab woman,
our society still assumes
											that her primary source of happiness
should be the happiness and prosperity
											of her children and husband.
											She mostly exists for her family.

that the professional Arab woman

											Here is how I do this in my personal life.
											One thing to know about the Middle East
											is that nearly every family
has access to affordable domestic help.
											The challenge therefore becomes
how to recruit effectively.
											Just like I would in my business life,
I have based the selection
											of who would support me
with my children while I&#39;m at work
											on a strong referral.
											Cristina had worked
for four years with my sister
											and the quality of her work
was well-established.
											She is now an integral
member of our family,
											having been with us
since Alia was six months old.
											She makes sure that the house
is running smoothly while I&#39;m at work,
											and I make sure to empower her
											in the most optimal conditions
for her and my children,
											just like I would my best talent at work.
											This lesson applies
whatever your childcare situation,
											whether an au pair, nursery,
											part-time nanny
that you share with someone else.
											Choose very carefully, and empower.

											If you look at my calendar,

											The Arab world, too, is making progress,
despite many recent setbacks.
											Just this year, the UAE appointed
five new female ministers to its cabinet,
											for a total of eight female ministers.
											That&#39;s nearly 28 percent of the cabinet,
											and more than many
developed countries can claim.
											This is today my daughter
Alia&#39;s favorite picture.
											This is the result,
no doubt, of great leadership,
											but it is also the result
of strong Arab women
											not giving up and continuously
pushing the boundaries.
											It is the result of Arab women
deciding every day like me
											to convert shit into fuel,
											to work their life
to keep work out of their life,
											and to join forces and not compete.

											As I look to the future,
											my hopes for my daughter
when she stands on this stage
											some 20, 30 years from now
											are that she be as proud
to call herself her mother&#39;s daughter
											as her father&#39;s daughter.
