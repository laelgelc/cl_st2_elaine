											Chris Anderson: Welcome
to this next edition of TED Dialogues.
											We&#39;re trying to do
some bridging here today.
											You know, the American dream
has inspired millions of people
											around the world for many years.
											Today, I think, you can say
that America is divided,
											perhaps more than ever,
											and the divisions seem
to be getting worse.
											It&#39;s actually really hard
for people on different sides
											to even have a conversation.
											People almost feel...
											disgusted with each other.
											Some families can&#39;t even speak
to each other right now.
											Our purpose in this dialogue today
is to try to do something about that,
											to try to have a different kind
of conversation,
											to do some listening, some thinking,
some understanding.
											And I have two people with us
to help us do that.

											They&#39;re not going to come at this
hammer and tong against each other.
											This is not like cable news.
											This is two people who have both spent
a lot of their working life
											in the political center
or right of the center.
											They&#39;ve immersed themselves
in conservative worldviews, if you like.
											They know that space very well.
											And we&#39;re going to explore together
											how to think about
what is happening right now,
											and whether we can find new ways to bridge
											and just to have wiser,
more connected conversations.

											With me, first of all, Gretchen Carlson,
											who has spent a decade
working at Fox News,
											hosting &quot;Fox and Friends&quot;
and then &quot;The Real Story,&quot;
											before taking a courageous stance
in filing sexual harassment claims
											against Roger Ailes,
											which eventually led
to his departure from Fox News.
											David Brooks, who has earned the wrath
											of many of [The New York Times&#39;s]
left-leaning readers
											because of his conservative views,
											and more recently, perhaps,
some of the right-leaning readers
											because of his criticism
of some aspects of Trump.
											Yet, his columns are usually
											the top one, two or three
most-read content of the day
											because they&#39;re brilliant,
											because they bring psychology
and social science
											to providing understanding
for what&#39;s going on.
											So without further ado, a huge welcome
to Gretchen and David.
											Come and join me.

											Gretchen Carlson: There are a lot
of reasons, in my mind, why it happened.
											I mean, I think it was a movement
of sorts, but it started long ago.
											It didn&#39;t just happen overnight.
											&quot;Anger&quot; would be the first word
that I would think of —
											anger with nothing
being done in Washington,
											anger about not being heard.
											I think there was a huge swath
of the population
											that feels like Washington
never listens to them,
											you know, a good part of the middle
of America, not just the coasts,
											and he was somebody they felt
was listening to their concerns.
											So I think those two issues
would be the main reason.
											I have to throw in there also celebrity.
											I think that had a huge impact
on Donald Trump becoming president.

											And having done that
and gotten that so wrong,
											I decided to spend the ensuing year
just out in Trumpworld,
											and I found a lot of economic dislocation.
											I ran into a woman in West Virginia
who was going to a funeral for her mom.
											She said, &quot;The nice thing about
being Catholic is we don&#39;t have to speak,
											and that&#39;s good,
because we&#39;re not word people.&quot;
											That phrase rung in my head: word people.
											A lot of us in the TED community
are word people,
											but if you&#39;re not, the economy
has not been angled toward you,
											and so 11 million men, for example,
are out of the labor force
											because those jobs are done away.
											A lot of social injury.
											You used to be able to say,
&quot;I&#39;m not the richest person in the world,
											I&#39;m not the most famous,
											but my neighbors can count on me
and I get some dignity out of that.&quot;
											And because of celebritification
or whatever, if you&#39;re not rich or famous,
											you feel invisible.
											And a lot of moral injury,
sense of feeling betrayed,
											and frankly, in this country,
we almost have one success story,
											which is you go to college, get
a white-collar job, and you&#39;re a success,
											and if you don&#39;t fit in that formula,
											you feel like you&#39;re not respected.
											And so that accumulation of things —
											and when I talked to Trump
voters and still do,
											I found most of them completely
realistic about his failings,
											but they said, this is my shot.

											GC: And yet I predicted
that he would be the nominee,
											because I&#39;ve known him for 27 years.
											He&#39;s a master marketer,
											and one of the things
he did extremely well
											that President Obama also did
extremely well,
											was simplifying the message,
											simplifying down to phrases
											and to a populist message.
											Even if he can&#39;t achieve it,
it sounded good.
											And many people latched on
to that simplicity again.
											It&#39;s something they could grasp onto:
											&quot;I get that. I want that.
That sounds fantastic.&quot;
											And I remember when he used to come
on my show originally,
											before &quot;The Apprentice&quot;
was even &quot;The Apprentice,&quot;
											and he&#39;d say it was the number
one show on TV.
											I&#39;d say back to him, &quot;No, it&#39;s not.&quot;
											And he would say, &quot;Yes it is, Gretchen.&quot;
											And I would say, &quot;No it&#39;s not.&quot;
											But people at home would see that,
and they&#39;d be like,
											&quot;Wow, I should be watching
the number one show on TV.&quot;
											And — lo and behold — it became
the number one show on TV.
											So he had this, I&#39;ve seen
this ability in him
											to be the master marketer.

and not being invisible anymore

											DB: I would say he understood what,
frankly, I didn&#39;t,
											which is what debate we were having.
											And so I&#39;d grown up starting with Reagan,
											and it was the big government
versus small government debate.
											It was Barry Goldwater
versus George McGovern,
											and that was the debate
we had been having for a generation.
											It was: Democrats wanted to use
government to enhance equality,
											Republicans wanted to limit government
to enhance freedom.
											That was the debate.
											He understood what I think
the two major parties did not,
											which was that&#39;s not the debate anymore.
											The debate is now open versus closed.
											On one side are those who have
the tailwinds of globalization
											and the meritocracy blowing at their back,
											and they tend to favor open trade,
											open borders, open social mores,
											because there are so many opportunities.
											On the other side are those
who feel the headwinds of globalization
											and the meritocracy
just blasting in their faces,
											and they favor closed trade,
closed borders, closed social mores,
											because they just want some security.
											And so he was right
on that fundamental issue,
											and people were willing
to overlook a lot to get there.
											And so he felt that sense of security.

											We&#39;re speaking the morning after
Trump&#39;s joint session speech.
											There are three traditional
groups in the Republican Party.
											There are the foreign policies hawks
											who believe in America
as global policeman.
											Trump totally repudiated that view.
											Second, there was the social conservatives
											who believed in religious liberty,
											pro-life,
											prayer in schools.
											He totally ignored that.
											There was not a single mention
of a single social conservative issue.
											And then there were the fiscal hawks,
											the people who wanted to cut down
on the national debt, Tea Party,
											cut the size of government.
											He&#39;s expanding the size of government!
											Here&#39;s a man who has single-handedly
revolutionized a major American party
											because he understood
where the debate was headed
											before other people.

											DB: I think that part is true,
											but there&#39;s another part
that&#39;s probably true, too.
											He&#39;s part of a global movement.
											It&#39;s like being around Marxists in 1917.
											There&#39;s him here, there&#39;s the UKIP party,
there&#39;s the National Front in France,
											there&#39;s Putin, there&#39;s a Turkish version,
a Philippine version.
											So we have to recognize that this
is a global intellectual movement.
											And it believes
											that wisdom and virtue is not held
in individual conversation and civility
											the way a lot of us
in the enlightenment side of the world do.
											It&#39;s held in — the German word
is the &quot;volk&quot; — in the people,
											in the common, instinctive wisdom
of the plain people.
											And the essential virtue of that people
is always being threatened by outsiders.
											And he&#39;s got a strategy
for how to get there.
											He&#39;s got a series of policies
to bring the people up
											and repudiate the outsiders,
											whether those outsiders
are Islam, Mexicans, the media,
											the coastal elites...
											And there&#39;s a whole worldview there;
it&#39;s a very coherent worldview.
											I sort of have more respect for him.

a huge difference between —
											I hate to put people in categories, but,
											Middle America versus
people who live on the coasts.
											It&#39;s an entirely different existence.
											And I grew up in Minnesota, so I have
an understanding of Middle America,

an understanding of what happened here,
											because those people often feel
like nobody&#39;s listening to them,
											and that we&#39;re only concentrating
on California and New York.
											And so I think that was a huge reason
why Trump was elected.
											I mean, these people felt like
they were being heard.
											Whether or not patriotism falls into that,
											I&#39;m not sure about that.
											I do know one thing:
											a lot of things Trump talked about
last night are not conservative things.
											Had Hillary Clinton gotten up
and given that speech,
											not one Republican would have
stood up to applaud.
											I mean, he&#39;s talking about spending
a trillion dollars on infrastructure.

maternity leave.

contradiction that he&#39;s got to confront,

is offering security.

for you, for my people.&quot;

at a lot of his economic policies,
											like health care reform, which is about
private health care accounts,
											that&#39;s not security, that&#39;s risk.
											Educational vouchers: that&#39;s risk.
Deregulation: that&#39;s risk.
											There&#39;s really a contradiction
between the security of the mindset
											and a lot of the policies,
which are very risk-oriented.
											And what I would say, especially
having spent this year,
											the people in rural Minnesota,
in New Mexico —
											they&#39;ve got enough risk in their lives.
											And so they&#39;re going to say,
&quot;No thank you.&quot;

will fail for that reason.

who has been conservative

											when you grow up conservative,
											you learn to speak both languages.
											Because if I&#39;m going to listen to music,
											I&#39;m not going to listen to Ted Nugent.
											So a lot of my favorite rock bands
are all on the left.
											If I&#39;m going to go to a school,
											I&#39;m going probably to school
where the culture is liberal.
											If I&#39;m going to watch a sitcom

it&#39;s going to be liberal.
											If I&#39;m going to read a good newspaper,
it&#39;ll be the New York Times.
											As a result, you learn
to speak both languages.
											And that actually, at least
for a number of years,
											when I started at National Review
with William F. Buckley,
											it made us sharper,

against people every day.
											The problem now that&#39;s happened
is you have ghettoization on the right

											So people follow the party
much more than they used to.
											So if you&#39;re waiting for Paul Ryan
and the Republicans in Congress
											to flake away,
											it&#39;s going to take a little while.

											CA: David. DB: Yeah, I guess I would say
											I don&#39;t think we can teach
each other to be civil,
											and give us sermons on civility.
											That&#39;s not going to do it.
											It&#39;s substance and how we act,
											and the nice thing about Donald Trump
is he smashed our categories.
											All the categories that we thought
we were thinking in, they&#39;re obsolete.
											They were great for the 20th century.
They&#39;re not good for today.
											He&#39;s got an agenda which is about
closing borders and closing trade.
											I just don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to work.
											I think if we want to rebuild
communities, recreate jobs,
											we need a different set of agenda
											that smashes through all our current
divisions and our current categories.
											For me, that agenda is Reaganism
on macroeconomic policy,
											Sweden on welfare policy
											and cuts across right and left.
											I think we have to have a dynamic
economy that creates growth.
											That&#39;s the Reagan on economic policy.
											But people have to have that secure base.
											There have to be
nurse-family partnerships;
											there has to be universal preschool;
											there have to be charter schools;
											there have to be college programs
with wraparound programs
											for parents and communities.
											We need to help heal the crisis
of social solidarity in this country
											and help heal families,
											and government just has to get
a lot more involved
											in the way liberals like
to rebuild communities.
											At the other hand, we have to have
an economy that&#39;s free and open
											the way conservatives used to like.
											And so getting the substance right
is how you smash through
											the partisan identities,
											because the substance is what
ultimately shapes our polarization.

In 2016, Carlson became the face of sexual harassment in the workplace after her lawsuit against Fox News Chairman and CEO Roger Ailes paved the way for thousands of other women facing harassment to tell their stories. Carlson&#39;s advocacy put her on the cover of <em>TIME</em>, and her new book,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://geni.us/bA2l5CE\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Be Fierce: Stop Harassment and Take Your Power Back</em></a>, joined the <em>New York Times</em> best-seller list the week it was published. She became a columnist for <em>TIME</em>&#39;s&nbsp;online &quot;Motto&quot; newsletter in 2017, focusing on gender and empowerment issues.</p><p>Carlson&#39;s ongoing work on behalf of women includes advocating for arbitration reform on Capitol Hill; in 2018, she plans to testify before Congress about workplace inequality and forced arbitration clauses in employment contracts. Carlson also created the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.gretchencarlson.com/philanthropy/\" target=\"_blank\">Gift of Courage Fund</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aitogether.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Gretchen Carlson Leadership Initiative</a>&nbsp;to support empowerment, advocacy and anti-harassment programs for girls and underserved women.</p><p>Carlson hosted &quot;The Real Story&quot; on Fox News for three years; co-hosted &quot;Fox and Friends&quot; for seven years; and in her first book,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://geni.us/mjTt\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Getting Real</em></a>, became a national best-seller. She co-hosted &quot;The Saturday Early Show&quot; for CBS in 2000 and served as a CBS News correspondent covering stories including Geneoa&#39;s G-8 Summit, Timothy McVeigh&rsquo;s execution, 9/11 from the World Trade Center and the Bush-Gore election. She started her reporting career in Richmond, Virginia, then served as an anchor and reporter in Cincinnati, Cleveland and Dallas, where she produced and reported a 30-part series on domestic violence that won several national awards.</p><p>An honors graduate of Stanford University, Carlson was valedictorian of her high school class and studied at Oxford University in England. A child prodigy on the violin, she performed as a soloist with the Minnesota Symphony Orchestra at age 13, and in 1989, became the first classical violinist to win the Miss America crown.</p><p>Ever grateful for the opportunities provided to her and imbued with a &quot;never give up&quot; attitude, Carlson has mentored dozens of young women throughout her career. She serves as a national&nbsp;trustee for the March of Dimes, a member of the board of directors for the Catherine Violet Hubbard Animal Sanctuary in Newtown, Connecticut and a trustee of Greenwich Academy, an all-girls preparatory day school in Greenwich, Connecticut. Carlson is married to sports agent Casey Close and mom to their two children.</p>"},{"id":"3332","slug":"vy_higginsen_s_gospel_choir_of_harlem","is_published":true,"firstname":"","lastname":"Vy Higginsen's Gospel Choir","middleinitial":"","title":"","description":"Gospel ensemble","photo_url":"https://pe.tedcdn.com/images/ted/9d4b8cb9a66362e48be5738571a05db45e1b165b_254x191.jpg","whatotherssay":"","whotheyare":"Vy Higginsen's Gospel Choir of Harlem is an influential source of education and self-development for young people.","whylisten":"<p>Vy Higginsen&#39;s Gospel Choir of Harlem is a celebrated group of performers elevated from the Mama Foundation for the Arts&#39; Music School of Gospel, Jazz and R&amp;B.

He spent his early years in India, Pakistan and Afghanistan, where his parents worked as medical missionaries, and he attended an American school in the Himalayas for his early education. After boarding school in Bath, England, he went on to Oxford University, graduating in 1978 with a degree in philosophy, politics and economics.</p><p class=\"p1\">Chris then trained as a journalist, working in newspapers and radio, including two years producing a world news service in the Seychelles Islands.</p><p class=\"p1\"> Back in the UK in 1984, Chris was captivated by the personal computer revolution and became an editor at one of the UK&#39;s early computer magazines. A year later he founded Future Publishing with a $25,000 bank loan. The new company initially focused on specialist computer publications but eventually expanded into other areas such as cycling, music, video games, technology and design, doubling in size every year for seven years. In 1994, Chris moved to the United States where he built Imagine Media, publisher of <em>Business 2.0</em> magazine and creator of the popular video game users website IGN. Chris eventually merged Imagine and Future, taking the combined entity public in London in 1999, under the Future name. At its peak, it published 150 magazines and websites and employed 2,000 people.</p><p class=\"p1\">This success allowed Chris to create a private nonprofit organization, the Sapling Foundation, with the hope of finding new ways to tackle tough global issues through media, technology, entrepreneurship and, most of all, ideas. In 2001, the foundation acquired the TED Conference, then an annual meeting of luminaries in the fields of Technology, Entertainment and Design held in Monterey, California, and Chris left Future to work full time on TED.</p><p class=\"p1\">He expanded the conference&#39;s remit to cover all topics, including science, business and key global issues, while adding a Fellows program, which now has some 300 alumni, and the TED Prize, which grants its recipients &quot;one wish to change the world.&quot; The TED stage has become a place for thinkers and doers from all fields to share their ideas and their work, capturing imaginations, sparking conversation and encouraging discovery along the way.</p><p class=\"p1\">In 2006, TED experimented with posting some of its talks on the Internet. Their viral success encouraged Chris to begin positioning the organization as a global media initiative devoted to &#39;ideas worth spreading,&#39; part of a new era of information dissemination using the power of online video. In June 2015, the organization posted its 2,000th talk online. The talks are free to view, and they have been translated into more than 100 languages with the help of volunteers from around the world. Viewership has grown to approximately one billion views per year.</p><p class=\"p1\">Continuing a strategy of &#39;radical openness,&#39; in 2009 Chris introduced the TEDx initiative, allowing free licenses to local organizers who wished to organize their own TED-like events. More than 8,000 such events have been held, generating an archive of 60,000 TEDx talks. And three years later, the TED-Ed program was launched, offering free educational videos and tools to students and teachers.</p>"}],"url":"https://www.ted.com/talks/gretchen_carlson_david_brooks_political_common_ground_in_a_polarized_united_states","viewed_count":1033640,"talks":[{"explore_cta_experiment":{},"curator_approved":true,"description":"How can we bridge the gap between left and right to have a wiser, more connected political conversation?

the nation&#39;s most highly acclaimed journalists and a warrior for women. In 2016, Carlson became the face of sexual harassment in the workplace after her lawsuit against Fox News Chairman and CEO Roger Ailes paved the way for thousands of other women facing harassment to tell their stories. Carlson&#39;s advocacy put her on the cover of <em>TIME</em>, and her new book,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://geni.us/bA2l5CE\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Be Fierce: Stop Harassment and Take Your Power Back</em></a>, joined the <em>New York Times</em> best-seller list the week it was published. She became a columnist for <em>TIME</em>&#39;s&nbsp;online &quot;Motto&quot; newsletter in 2017, focusing on gender and empowerment issues.</p><p>Carlson&#39;s ongoing work on behalf of women includes advocating for arbitration reform on Capitol Hill; in 2018, she plans to testify before Congress about workplace inequality and forced arbitration clauses in employment contracts. Carlson also created the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.gretchencarlson.com/philanthropy/\" target=\"_blank\">Gift of Courage Fund</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aitogether.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Gretchen Carlson Leadership Initiative</a>&nbsp;to support empowerment, advocacy and anti-harassment programs for girls and underserved women.</p><p>Carlson hosted &quot;The Real Story&quot; on Fox News for three years; co-hosted &quot;Fox and Friends&quot; for seven years; and in her first book,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://geni.us/mjTt\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Getting Real</em></a>, became a national best-seller. She co-hosted &quot;The Saturday Early Show&quot; for CBS in 2000 and served as a CBS News correspondent covering stories including Geneoa&#39;s G-8 Summit, Timothy McVeigh&rsquo;s execution, 9/11 from the World Trade Center and the Bush-Gore election. She started her reporting career in Richmond, Virginia, then served as an anchor and reporter in Cincinnati, Cleveland and Dallas, where she produced and reported a 30-part series on domestic violence that won several national awards.</p><p>An honors graduate of Stanford University, Carlson was valedictorian of her high school class and studied at Oxford University in England. A child prodigy on the violin, she performed as a soloist with the Minnesota Symphony Orchestra at age 13, and in 1989, became the first classical violinist to win the Miss America crown.</p><p>Ever grateful for the opportunities provided to her and imbued with a &quot;never give up&quot; attitude, Carlson has mentored dozens of young women throughout her career. She serves as a national&nbsp;trustee for the March of Dimes, a member of the board of directors for the Catherine Violet Hubbard Animal Sanctuary in Newtown, Connecticut and a trustee of Greenwich Academy, an all-girls preparatory day school in Greenwich, Connecticut. Carlson is married to sports agent Casey Close and mom to their two children.</p>"},{"id":"3332","slug":"vy_higginsen_s_gospel_choir_of_harlem","is_published":true,"firstname":"","lastname":"Vy Higginsen's Gospel Choir","middleinitial":"","title":"","description":"Gospel ensemble","photo_url":"https://pe.tedcdn.com/images/ted/9d4b8cb9a66362e48be5738571a05db45e1b165b_254x191.jpg","whatotherssay":"","whotheyare":"Vy Higginsen's Gospel Choir of Harlem is an influential source of education and self-development for young people.","whylisten":"<p>Vy Higginsen&#39;s Gospel Choir of Harlem is a celebrated group of performers elevated from the Mama Foundation for the Arts&#39; Music School of Gospel, Jazz and R&amp;B.

He spent his early years in India, Pakistan and Afghanistan, where his parents worked as medical missionaries, and he attended an American school in the Himalayas for his early education. After boarding school in Bath, England, he went on to Oxford University, graduating in 1978 with a degree in philosophy, politics and economics.</p><p class=\"p1\">Chris then trained as a journalist, working in newspapers and radio, including two years producing a world news service in the Seychelles Islands.</p><p class=\"p1\"> Back in the UK in 1984, Chris was captivated by the personal computer revolution and became an editor at one of the UK&#39;s early computer magazines. A year later he founded Future Publishing with a $25,000 bank loan. The new company initially focused on specialist computer publications but eventually expanded into other areas such as cycling, music, video games, technology and design, doubling in size every year for seven years. In 1994, Chris moved to the United States where he built Imagine Media, publisher of <em>Business 2.0</em> magazine and creator of the popular video game users website IGN. Chris eventually merged Imagine and Future, taking the combined entity public in London in 1999, under the Future name. At its peak, it published 150 magazines and websites and employed 2,000 people.</p><p class=\"p1\">This success allowed Chris to create a private nonprofit organization, the Sapling Foundation, with the hope of finding new ways to tackle tough global issues through media, technology, entrepreneurship and, most of all, ideas. In 2001, the foundation acquired the TED Conference, then an annual meeting of luminaries in the fields of Technology, Entertainment and Design held in Monterey, California, and Chris left Future to work full time on TED.</p><p class=\"p1\">He expanded the conference&#39;s remit to cover all topics, including science, business and key global issues, while adding a Fellows program, which now has some 300 alumni, and the TED Prize, which grants its recipients &quot;one wish to change the world.&quot; The TED stage has become a place for thinkers and doers from all fields to share their ideas and their work, capturing imaginations, sparking conversation and encouraging discovery along the way.</p><p class=\"p1\">In 2006, TED experimented with posting some of its talks on the Internet. Their viral success encouraged Chris to begin positioning the organization as a global media initiative devoted to &#39;ideas worth spreading,&#39; part of a new era of information dissemination using the power of online video. In June 2015, the organization posted its 2,000th talk online. The talks are free to view, and they have been translated into more than 100 languages with the help of volunteers from around the world. Viewership has grown to approximately one billion views per year.</p><p class=\"p1\">Continuing a strategy of &#39;radical openness,&#39; in 2009 Chris introduced the TEDx initiative, allowing free licenses to local organizers who wished to organize their own TED-like events. More than 8,000 such events have been held, generating an archive of 60,000 TEDx talks. And three years later, the TED-Ed program was launched, offering free educational videos and tools to students and teachers.</p>"}],"speaker_name":"Gretchen Carlson, David Brooks","tags":["collaboration","communication","democracy","government","future","history","humanity","immigration","identity","inequality","infrastructure","journalism","policy","news","security","politics","social media","social change","women","United States","writing"],"title":"Political common ground in a polarized United States","video_type":{"id":"1","name":"TED Stage Talk"},"viewed_count":1033640}]}})</script></div>
