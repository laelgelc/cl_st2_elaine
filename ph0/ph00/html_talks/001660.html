<title>Sandi Toksvig: A political party for women&#39;s equality | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Women&#39;s equality won&#39;t just happen -- not unless more women are put in positions of power, says Sandi Toksvig. In a disarmingly hilarious talk, Toksvig tells the story of how she helped start a new political party in Britain, the Women&#39;s Equality Party, with the express purpose of putting equality on the ballot. Now she hopes people around the world will copy her party&#39;s model and mobilize for equality." />

<meta content="Women's equality won't just happen — not unless more women are put in positions of power, says Sandi Toksvig. In a disarmingly hilarious talk, Toksvig tells the story of how she helped start a new political party in Britain, the Women's Equality Party, with the express purpose of putting equality on the ballot. Now she hopes people around the world will copy her party's model and mobilize for equality." itemprop='description'>

pressed when you think,

an injustice of some kind,
											sometimes an illness strikes,
											or you&#39;re born in some way disadvantaged,
											or perhaps underprivileged.
											So I was born gay, OK?
											I&#39;ve always known,

were the least bit surprised.
											Here is a picture of me aged four.

											So my activation button
was pressed when I had my kids —
											three wonderful kids,
born to my then-partner.
											Now here&#39;s the thing:
I work on television in Britain.
											By the time they were born,
I was already hosting my own shows
											and working in the public eye.
											I love what I do,
											but I love my kids more.
											And I didn&#39;t want them
to grow up with a secret.
											1994, when my son, my youngest was born,
											there was not, as far as I was aware,
											a single out, gay woman
in British public life.
											I don&#39;t think secrets are a good thing.

											Everybody warned me
that I would never work again,
											but I decided it was
absolutely worth the risk.
											Well, it was hell.
											In Britain, we have a particularly vicious
section of the right-wing press,
											and they went nuts.
											And their hatred stirred up
the less stable elements of society,
											and we got death threats —
											enough death threats
that I had to take the kids into hiding,
											and we had to have police protection.
											And I promise you there were
many moments in the still of the night
											when I was terrified by what I had done.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">

											Eventually the dust settled.
											Against all expectation
I carried on working,
											and my kids were and continue
to be absolutely fantastic.
											I remember when my son was six,
he had a friend over to play.
											They were in the next room;
I could hear them chatting.
											The friend said to my son,
&quot;What&#39;s it like having two mums?&quot;
											I was a little anxious to hear,
so I leant in to hear and my son said,
											&quot;It&#39;s fantastic,
because if one of them&#39;s sick,
											you&#39;ve still got another one
to cook for you.&quot;

for gay equality was pressed,

											Within 10 months,
											we had more than 70 branches
of our party across the UK.
											We stood candidates for election
in London, Scotland and Wales
											in May 2016.
											One in 20 people voted
for our candidate for London Mayor.
											And when the men in the race
saw how many votes we were attracting,
											wonder of wonders,

to tackle gender equality.

											You know, I&#39;ve been promised
change since I was a child.
											It was always coming:
											women were going to stand
shoulder to shoulder with men.
											All I got were empty promises
and disappointment —
											enough disappointment
to found a political party.
											But here is my new idea for today —
this is my five percent, OK?
											And this one is really good.
											The fact is, this is not enough.
											It is not enough to found one political
party for equality in a single country.
											What we need is a seismic change
in the global political landscape.
											And the wonderful thing
about the model we have created
											is that it would work anywhere.
											It would work in America,
											it would work in Australia,
it would work in India.
											It&#39;s like we&#39;ve made the perfect recipe:
anybody can cook it,
											and it&#39;s good for everybody.
											And we want to give it away.
											If you want to know what we did,
we&#39;re giving it away.
											Can you imagine if we could mobilize
millions of women across the world
											to say, &quot;That&#39;s enough!&quot;
to the traditional battles of politics?
											To say, &quot;Stop the bickering,
let&#39;s get the work done.&quot;
											We could literally change the world.
											And I want that.

Waiting for what? For women to be treated the same as men, to have the same opportunities, the same representation in the top ranks of business and government and the same salaries, and for Britain’s major political parties to take the issues seriously.","whotheyare":"Long revered in the UK for her wit and candor, Sandi Toksvig is now lending her familiar voice to a greater cause -- equality for women.","whylisten":"<p>Sandi Toksvig OBE is an award-winning writer, broadcaster and performer. She was born in Copenhagen, Denmark but grew up traveling the world with her family as they followed the work of her father, Claus Toksvig, Danish television&#39;s most famous foreign correspondent. Toksvig&nbsp;gave her own first television interview when she was six. &nbsp;After graduating with a first class degree from Cambridge University she began her acting career first at Nottingham Playhouse and then the Open Air Theatre in Regent&#39;s Park.</p><p>Toksvig&#39;s first experience of live television was when she hosted and co-wrote the children&#39;s Saturday morning show &quot;No 73,&quot; which she did for six years. Other TV followed including the improvisation show, &quot;Whose Line is it Anyway?&quot; and six years as team captain on &quot;Call My Bluff.&quot; Toksvig&nbsp;is the new host of the BBC&#39;s entertainment show <em>QI</em> and is currently recording the eighth season hosting the game show &quot;15-1&quot; for Channel 4. She has also had recent acting cameos in &quot;Call the Midwife&quot; and &quot;Up the Women.&quot; Toksvig is well known on BBC Radio 4 for her appearances on &quot;I&#39;m Sorry I Haven&#39;t a Clue&quot; as well as hosting &quot;Excess Baggage&quot; and the News Quiz.</p><p>Toksvig has also produced television. The current Playhouse Presents strand on Sky Arts was conceived by her and she produced and wrote much of the content for the first three years.</p><p>Toksvig has written over twenty books including fact and fiction for both children and adults. Her stage play,<em> Bully Boy</em>, was the opening production of London&#39;s newest theatre, the St James. The piece also had a successful run in Copenhagen. Her latest novel <em>The End of the Sky</em>, set on the Oregon Trail in 1847, will be published in 2017. It&#39;s a sequel to her last novel <em>A Slice of the Moon</em> about the Irish potato famine. Her new comedy play <em>Silver Linings</em> deals with society&#39;s attitudes to older women. It will open at the Rose Theatre in February 2017 before going on tour. &nbsp;Toksvig&nbsp;has written a column for <em>Good Housekeeping</em> magazine for twenty years.</p><p>In March 2015, along with journalist Catherine Mayer, Toksvig&nbsp;co-founded Britain&#39;s newest political party, The Women&rsquo;s Equality Party (WEP), which in one year of existence now has over 70 branches across the UK. WEP stood candidates in the London, Welsh and Scottish elections of May 2016.</p><p>Toksvig has many honorary degrees. She is the President of the Women of the Year Lunch, Chancellor of the University of Portsmouth and in 2014 she was made an Officer of the British Empire by the Queen.</p>"}],"speaker_name":"Sandi Toksvig","tags":["activism","feminism","gender equality","global issues","government","history","inequality","motivation","personal growth","politics","social change","society","women"],"title":"A political party for women's equality","video_type":{"id":"1","name":"TED Stage Talk"},"viewed_count":904025}]}})</script></div>
