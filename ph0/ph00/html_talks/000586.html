											And I think it&#39;s because

											I think inside at some point, we put

of living, the success level of living,

											Do you figure out,
&quot;What on Earth am I here for?&quot;
											I meet a lot of people who are very smart,

of meaning, of significance, of purpose.
											I think it comes down to this issue of:
											&quot;Why am I here? What am I here for?
Where am I going?&quot;
											These are not religious issues.

											I wanted to tell Michael before he spoke
that I really appreciate what he does,

a whole lot easier.
											As a pastor, I do see a lot of kooks.

kooks in every area of life.
											Religion doesn&#39;t have a monopoly on that,

											There are secular kooks;

											When the book became the best-selling book
in the world for the last three years,
											I kind of had my little crisis.
											And that was: What is the purpose of this?
											Because it brought in
enormous amounts of money.
											When you write the best-selling
book in the world,
											it&#39;s tons and tons of money.
											And it brought in a lot of attention,
neither of which I wanted.
											When I started Saddleback Church,
I was 25 years old.
											I started it with
one other family in 1980.
											And I decided that I was never
going to go on TV,
											because I didn&#39;t want to be a celebrity.
											I didn&#39;t want to be a, quote,
&quot;evangelist, televangelist&quot; —
											that&#39;s not my thing.
											And all of the sudden, it brought a lot
of money and a lot of attention.
											I don&#39;t think —
											now, this is a worldview,
											and I will tell you,
everybody&#39;s got a worldview.

											Everybody&#39;s betting
their life on something.
											You&#39;re betting your life on something,
											you just better know why
you&#39;re betting what you&#39;re betting on.
											So, everybody&#39;s betting
their life on something.
											And when I, you know, made a bet,
											I happened to believe
that Jesus was who he said he was.
											And I believe in a pluralistic society,
											everybody&#39;s betting on something.
											And when I started the church,
											you know, I had no plans
to do what it&#39;s doing now.
											And then when I wrote this book,
											and all of a sudden, it just took off,
											and I started saying, now,
what&#39;s the purpose of this?
											Because as I started to say,
											I don&#39;t think you&#39;re given money or fame
											for your own ego, ever.
											I just don&#39;t believe that.
											And when you write a book
that the first sentence of the book is,
											&quot;It&#39;s not about you,&quot;
											then, when all of a sudden it becomes
the best-selling book in history,
											you&#39;ve got to figure, well,
I guess it&#39;s not about me.
											That&#39;s kind of a no-brainer.

											And I began to think about what I call
the &quot;stewardship of affluence&quot;
											and the &quot;stewardship of influence.&quot;
											So I believe, essentially,
leadership is stewardship.
											That if you are a leader in any area —
											in business, in politics,
in sports, in art,
											in academics, in any area —
											you don&#39;t own it.
											You are a steward of it.
											For instance, that&#39;s why I believe
in protecting the environment.
											This is not my planet.

it&#39;s not going to be mine after I die,

											I was debating
the other day on a talk show,
											and the guy was challenging
me and he&#39;d go,
											&quot;What&#39;s a pastor doing
on protecting the environment?&quot;
											And I asked this guy, I said,
&quot;Well, do you believe
											that human beings are responsible
											to make the world a little bit better
place for the next generation?
											Do you think we have a stewardship here,
to take the environment seriously?&quot;
											And he said, &quot;No.&quot;
											I said, &quot;Oh, you don&#39;t?&quot;
											I said, &quot;Let me make this clear again:
											Do you believe that as human beings —
I&#39;m not talking about religion —
											do you believe that as human beings,
it is our responsibility
											to take care of this planet,
											and make it just a little bit better
for the next generation?&quot;
											And he said, &quot;No. Not any more
than any other species.&quot;
											When he said the word &quot;species,&quot;
he was revealing his worldview.
											And he was saying,
											&quot;I&#39;m no more responsible to take care
of this environment than a duck is.&quot;
											Well now, I know a lot
of times we act like ducks,
											but you&#39;re not a duck.
											You&#39;re not a duck.
											And you are responsible —
that&#39;s my worldview.
											And so, you need to understand
what your worldview is.

											So all of this money started pouring in,
											and all of this fame started pouring in.
											And I&#39;m going, what do I do with this?
											My wife and I first made five decisions
on what to do with the money.
											We said, &quot;First, we&#39;re not
going to use it on ourselves.&quot;
											I didn&#39;t go out and buy a bigger house.
											I don&#39;t own a guesthouse.
											I still drive the same four year-old
Ford that I&#39;ve driven.
											We just said, we&#39;re not
going to use it on us.
											The second thing was,
											I stopped taking a salary
from the church that I pastor.
											Third thing is, I added up
all that the church had paid me
											over the last 25 years,
and I gave it back.
											And I gave it back because
I didn&#39;t want anybody thinking
											that I do what I do for money — I don&#39;t.
											In fact, personally, I&#39;ve never met
											a priest or a pastor or a minister
who does it for money.
											I know that&#39;s the stereotype;
I&#39;ve never met one of them.
											Believe me, there&#39;s a whole lot
easier ways to make money.

											Pastors are like on 24 hours-a-day call,
they&#39;re like doctors.
											I left late today — I&#39;d hoped
to be here yesterday —

is in his last, probably, 48 hours

who&#39;s lived his life —

and he&#39;s dying with peace.
											You know, the test of your worldview
is not how you act in the good times.
											The test of your worldview
is how you act at the funeral.
											And having been through literally
hundreds if not thousands of funerals,
											it makes a difference.
											It makes a difference what you believe.

											So, we gave it all back,
											and then we set up three foundations,
											working on some of the major
problems of the world:
											illiteracy, poverty, pandemic diseases —
particularly HIV/AIDS —
											and set up these three foundations,
and put the money into that.
											The last thing we did is we became
what I call &quot;reverse tithers.&quot;
											And that is, when my wife
and I got married 30 years ago,
											we started tithing.
											Now, that&#39;s a principle in the Bible
											that says give 10 percent
of what you get back to charity,
											give it away to help other people.
											So, we started doing that, and each year
we would raise our tithe one percent.
											So, our first year of marriage
we went to 11 percent,
											second year we went to 12 percent,
											and the third year we went to 13 percent,

											Why did I do that?

											So, the good life is not about looking
good, feeling good or having the goods,

											Giving your life away.
											Significance in life

											because you can always find
somebody who&#39;s got more than you.
											It doesn&#39;t come from sex.
											It doesn&#39;t come from salary.

											It is in giving our lives away

											we find significance.

											And so we began to give away,

we give away 90 percent and live on 10.

											And, being a pastor,
I started reading the Bible.
											There&#39;s a chapter in the Bible
called Psalm 72,
											and it&#39;s Solomon&#39;s prayer
for more influence.
											When you read this prayer,
											it sounds incredibly
selfish, self-centered.
											He says, &quot;God, I want you
to make me famous.&quot;
											That&#39;s what he prays.
											He said, &quot;I want you to make me famous.
											I want you to spread the fame
of my name through every land,
											I want you to give me power.
											I want you to make me famous,
I want you to give me influence.&quot;
											And it just sounds like the most
egotistical request you could make,
											if you were going to pray.
											Until you read the whole psalm,
the whole chapter.
											And then he says,
&quot;So that the king ...&quot; —
											he was the king of Israel
at that time, at its apex in power —
											&quot;... so that the king may care
for the widow and orphan,
											support the oppressed, defend
the defenseless, care for the sick,
											assist the poor,
speak up for the foreigner,
											those in prison.&quot;
											Basically, he&#39;s talking about
all the marginalized in society.

is not to build your ego.
											Or your net worth.
											And, by the way, your net worth is not
the same thing as your self-worth.
											Your value is not based on your valuables.
											It&#39;s based on a whole
different set of things.
											And so the purpose
of influence is to speak up
											for those who have no influence.
											And I had to admit:
											I can&#39;t think of the last time
I thought of widows and orphans.
											They&#39;re not on my radar.
											I pastor a church in one of the most
affluent areas of America —
											a bunch of gated communities.
											I have a church full
of CEOs and scientists.
											And I could go five years and never,
ever see a homeless person.
											They&#39;re just not in my pathway.
											Now, they&#39;re 13 miles

											So I had to say, ok,

											Now, what was in Moses&#39; hand?
											Well, it was a shepherd&#39;s staff.
Now, follow me on this.

											This staff represented
three things about Moses&#39; life.
											First, it represented his identity;
he was a shepherd.
											It&#39;s the symbol of his own occupation:
											I am a shepherd.
											It&#39;s a symbol of his identity,
his career, his job.
											Second, it&#39;s a symbol
of not only his identity,
											it&#39;s a symbol of his income, because all
of his assets are tied up in sheep.
											In those days, nobody had bank accounts,
or American Express cards, or hedge funds.
											Your assets are tied up in your flocks.
											So it&#39;s a symbol of his identity,
and it&#39;s a symbol of his income.
											And the third thing:
it&#39;s a symbol of his influence.
											What do you do with a shepherd&#39;s staff?
											Well, you know, you move sheep
from point A to point B with it,
											by hook or by crook.
											You pull them or you poke them.
One or the other.
											So, he&#39;s saying,
											&quot;You&#39;re going to lay down your identity.
											What&#39;s in your hand?
											You&#39;ve got identity, you&#39;ve got income,
you&#39;ve got influence.
											What&#39;s in your hand?&quot;
											And he&#39;s saying, &quot;If you lay it down,
I&#39;ll make it come alive.
											I&#39;ll do some things
you could never imagine possible.&quot;
											And if you&#39;ve watched that movie,
&quot;Ten Commandments,&quot;
											all of those big miracles that happen
in Egypt are done through this staff.

											Last year, I was invited to speak
at the NBA All-Stars game.
											And so, I&#39;m talking to the players,
											because most of the NBA teams,
NFL teams and all the other teams
											have done this 40 Days of Purpose,
based on the book.
											And I asked them, I said,
&quot;What&#39;s in your hand?
											So, what&#39;s in your hand?&quot;
I said, &quot;It&#39;s a basketball.
											And that basketball represents
your identity, who you are:
											you&#39;re an NBA player.
											It represents your income:
											you&#39;re making a lot of money
off that little ball.
											And it represents your influence.
											And even though you&#39;re only going
to be in the NBA for a few years,
											you&#39;re going to be an NBA player
for the rest of your life.
											And that gives you enormous influence.
											So, what are you going to do
with what you&#39;ve been given?&quot;

											And I guess that&#39;s the main reason
I came up here today,
											to all of you very bright people at TED —
											it is to say, &quot;What&#39;s in your hand?&quot;
											What do you have that you&#39;ve been given?
											Talent, background, education,
											freedom, networks, opportunities,
											wealth, ideas, creativity.
											What are you doing
with what you&#39;ve been given?
											That, to me, is the primary
question about life.
											That, to me, is what being
purpose-driven is all about.
											In the book, I talk about
how you&#39;re wired to do certain things,
											you&#39;re &quot;SHAPED&quot; with — a little acrostic:
Spiritual gifts, Heart,
											Ability, Personality and Experiences.
											These things shape you.
											And if you want to know what you ought
to be doing with your life,
											you need to look at your shape —
&quot;What am I wired to do?&quot;
											Why would God wire you to do something
and then not have you do it?
											If you&#39;re wired to be an anthropologist,
you&#39;ll be an anthropologist.
											If you&#39;re wired to be
an undersea explorer,
											you&#39;ll be an undersea explorer.
											If you&#39;re wired to make deals,
you make deals.
											If you&#39;re wired to paint, you paint.

											Did you know that God smiles
when you be you?
											When my little kids —
when my kids were little —
											they&#39;re all grown now, I have grandkids —
											I used to go in and sit
on the side of their bed,
											and I used to watch my kids sleep.
											And I just watched their little bodies
rise and lower, rise and lower.
											And I would look at them:
&quot;This is not an accident.&quot;
											Rise and lower.
											And I got joy out of just
watching them sleep.
											Some people have the misguided idea
that God only gets excited
											when you&#39;re doing, quote,
&quot;spiritual things,&quot;
											like going to church or helping the poor,
											or, you know, confessing
or doing something like that.
											The bottom line is, God gets pleasure
watching you be you.
											Why? He made you.
											And when you do what you were made to do,
											he goes, &quot;That&#39;s my boy! That&#39;s my girl!
											You&#39;re using the talent
and ability that I gave you.&quot;

											So my advice to you is:
											look at what&#39;s in your hand —
											your identity, your influence,
your income —
											and say, &quot;It&#39;s not about me.
											It&#39;s about making the world
a better place.&quot;

He and his wife famously became &quot;reverse tithers,&quot; donating 90 percent of their considerable fortune to philanthropic causes. Warren is particularly passionate about fighting AIDS, and in 2006, his church hosted the second annual <a href=\"http://www.purposedriven.com/en-US/HIVAIDSCommunity/GlobalConference/What_one_church_is_doing_after_the_Summit.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Global Summit on AIDS</a>  and the Church, attended by US Senator Barack Obama, among others (controversial within the evangelical movement, because Obama is pro-choice). <br /><br />In recent years, Warren has become <strong>a prominent steward of social justice</strong>, speaking out on poverty relief and encouraging spiritual leaders to play a role in <strong>guiding the planet toward sustainability</strong>. (He even attended the premiere of <em><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0497116/\" target=\"_blank\">An Inconvenient Truth</a>,</em> after meeting Al Gore and producer Lawrence Bender at TED2006.) <br /><br />Given his global focus and considerable platform, <strong>Warren has become a sought-after advisor to world leaders</strong>, speaking at the <a href=\"http://www.un.org/\" target=\"_blank\">United Nations</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.weforum.org/en/index.htm\" target=\"_blank\">World Economic Forum</a>  and the <a href=\"http://www.cfr.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Council on Foreign Relations</a>. His involvement in the 2008 Presidential election sparked controversy and praise from both sides; during the campaign trail, he hosted candidates John McCain and Barack Obama at Saddleback Church for a forum on moral issues. It was the first time McCain and Obama appeared together publicly as presidential candidates. When Barack Obama was later elected to office, he asked Warren to give the invocation at his inauguration.&nbsp;</p>"}],"url":"https://www.ted.com/talks/rick_warren_on_a_life_of_purpose","viewed_count":3885383,"talks":[{"explore_cta_experiment":{},"curator_approved":true,"description":"Pastor Rick Warren, author of \"The Purpose-Driven Life,\" reflects on his own crisis of purpose in the wake of his book's wild success.

","whotheyare":"Pastor Rick Warren is the author of <em>The Purpose-Driven Life,</em> which has sold more than 30 million copies worldwide. His has become an immensely influential voice seeking to apply the values of his faith to issues such as global poverty, HIV/AIDS and injustice.","whylisten":"<p>Pastor Rick Warren is one of the world&#39;s most influential Christians. His <a href=\"http://www.saddleback.com/flash/default.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Saddleback Church</a>, founded in 1980, boasts a congregation of 22,000, and his <a href=\"http://www.purposedrivenlife.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Purpose-Driven Life</em></a>  is one of the best-selling books of all time. <strong>Warren&#39;s mission is to attack what he calls the five &quot;Global Goliaths&quot; -- spiritual emptiness, egocentric leadership, extreme poverty, pandemic disease, and illiteracy and poor education.</strong> </p><p>He teaches that <strong>doing good is the only way humans create significance in our lives</strong>. He and his wife famously became &quot;reverse tithers,&quot; donating 90 percent of their considerable fortune to philanthropic causes. Warren is particularly passionate about fighting AIDS, and in 2006, his church hosted the second annual <a href=\"http://www.purposedriven.com/en-US/HIVAIDSCommunity/GlobalConference/What_one_church_is_doing_after_the_Summit.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Global Summit on AIDS</a>  and the Church, attended by US Senator Barack Obama, among others (controversial within the evangelical movement, because Obama is pro-choice). <br /><br />In recent years, Warren has become <strong>a prominent steward of social justice</strong>, speaking out on poverty relief and encouraging spiritual leaders to play a role in <strong>guiding the planet toward sustainability</strong>. (He even attended the premiere of <em><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0497116/\" target=\"_blank\">An Inconvenient Truth</a>,</em> after meeting Al Gore and producer Lawrence Bender at TED2006.) <br /><br />Given his global focus and considerable platform, <strong>Warren has become a sought-after advisor to world leaders</strong>, speaking at the <a href=\"http://www.un.org/\" target=\"_blank\">United Nations</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.weforum.org/en/index.htm\" target=\"_blank\">World Economic Forum</a>  and the <a href=\"http://www.cfr.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Council on Foreign Relations</a>. His involvement in the 2008 Presidential election sparked controversy and praise from both sides; during the campaign trail, he hosted candidates John McCain and Barack Obama at Saddleback Church for a forum on moral issues. It was the first time McCain and Obama appeared together publicly as presidential candidates. When Barack Obama was later elected to office, he asked Warren to give the invocation at his inauguration.&nbsp;</p>"}],"speaker_name":"Rick Warren","tags":["Christianity","God","culture","happiness","leadership","motivation","philanthropy","religion"],"title":"A life of purpose","video_type":{"id":"1","name":"TED Stage Talk"},"viewed_count":3885383}]}})</script></div>
