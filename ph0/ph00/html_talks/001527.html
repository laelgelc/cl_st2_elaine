In this classic talk that started a worldwide conversation about feminism, Adichie asks that we begin to dream about and plan for a different, fairer world — of happier men and women who are truer to themselves." itemprop='description'>

											So I would like to start by telling you
about one of my greatest friends,
											Okoloma Maduewesi.
											Okoloma lived on my street
											and looked after me like a big brother.
											If I liked a boy,
I would ask Okoloma&#39;s opinion.
											Okoloma died in the notorious
Sosoliso plane crash
											in Nigeria in December of 2005.
											Almost exactly seven years ago.
											Okoloma was a person I could argue with,
laugh with and truly talk to.
											He was also the first person
to call me a feminist.

											I was about fourteen,
we were at his house, arguing.
											Both of us bristling
with half bit knowledge
											from books that we had read.
											I don&#39;t remember what this
particular argument was about,
											but I remember
that as I argued and argued,
											Okoloma looked at me and said,
&quot;You know, you&#39;re a feminist.&quot;
											It was not a compliment.

											I did not know exactly
what this word &quot;feminist&quot; meant,

I planned to do when I got home

&quot;feminist&quot; in the dictionary.

											Now fast forward to some years later,
											I wrote a novel about a man
who among other things beats his wife
											and whose story doesn&#39;t end very well.
											While I was promoting
the novel in Nigeria,
											a journalist, a nice, well-meaning man,
											told me he wanted to advise me.
											And for the Nigerians here,
											I&#39;m sure we&#39;re all familiar
											with how quick our people are
to give unsolicited advice.
											He told me that people were saying
that my novel was feminist
											and his advice to me —
											and he was shaking his head
sadly as he spoke —
											was that I should never
call myself a feminist
											because feminists
are women who are unhappy
											because they cannot find husbands.

											So I decided to call myself
&quot;a happy feminist.&quot;
											Then an academic, a Nigerian woman told me
											that feminism was not our culture
											and that feminism wasn&#39;t African,
											and that I was calling myself a feminist
											because I had been corrupted
by &quot;Western books.&quot;
											Which amused me,
											because a lot of my early readings
were decidedly unfeminist.
											I think I must have read every single
Mills &amp; Boon romance published
											before I was sixteen.
											And each time I tried to read those books
											called &quot;the feminist classics,&quot;
											I&#39;d get bored, and I really
struggled to finish them.
											But anyway, since feminism was un-African,
											I decided that I would now call myself
&quot;a happy African feminist.&quot;
											At some point I was a happy African
feminist who does not hate men
											and who likes lip gloss
											and who wears high heels
for herself but not for men.

											Now here&#39;s a story from my childhood.
											When I was in primary school,
											my teacher said at the beginning of term
that she would give the class a test
											and whoever got the highest score
would be the class monitor.
											Now, class monitor was a big deal.
											If you were a class monitor,
											you got to write down
the names of noisemakers —

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											which was having enough power of its own.
											But my teacher would also give you
a cane to hold in your hand
											while you walk around
and patrol the class for noisemakers.
											Now, of course you were not
actually allowed to use the cane.
											But it was an exciting prospect
for the nine-year-old me.
											I very much wanted
to be the class monitor.
											And I got the highest score on the test.
											Then, to my surprise, my teacher said
that the monitor had to be a boy.
											She had forgotten
to make that clear earlier
											because she assumed it was ... obvious.

									<p>
											A boy had the second highest
score on the test,
											and he would be monitor.
											Now, what was even more
interesting about this
											is that the boy was a sweet, gentle soul
											who had no interest
in patrolling the class with the cane,
											while I was full of ambition to do so.
											But I was female and he was male,
											and so he became the class monitor.
											And I&#39;ve never forgotten that incident.

											I often make the mistake of thinking
											that something that is obvious to me
is just as obvious to everyone else.
											Now, take my dear friend Louis
											for example.
											Louis is a brilliant, progressive man,
											and we would have conversations
and he would tell me,
											&quot;I don&#39;t know what you mean by things
being different or harder for women.
											Maybe in the past, but not now.&quot;
											And I didn&#39;t understand how Louis
could not see what seems so self-evident.
											Then one evening, in Lagos,
Louis and I went out with friends.
											And for people here
who are not familiar with Lagos,
											there&#39;s that wonderful Lagos&#39; fixture,
											the sprinkling of energetic men
who hang around outside establishments
											and very dramatically
&quot;help&quot; you park your car.
											I was impressed
with the particular theatrics
											of the man who found us
a parking spot that evening.
											And so as we were leaving,
I decided to leave him a tip.
											I opened my bag,
											put my hand inside my bag,
											brought out my money
that I had earned from doing my work,
											and I gave it to the man.
											And he, this man who was
very grateful and very happy,
											took the money from me,
											looked across at Louis
											and said, &quot;Thank you, sir!&quot;

											Men have testosterone and are
in general physically stronger than women.
											There&#39;s slightly more women
than men in the world,
											about 52 percent of the world&#39;s
population is female.
											But most of the positions of power
and prestige are occupied by men.
											The late Kenyan Nobel Peace laureate,
											Wangari Maathai,
											put it simply and well when she said:
											&quot;The higher you go,
the fewer women there are.&quot;
											In the recent US elections we kept hearing
of the Lilly Ledbetter law,
											and if we go beyond the nicely
alliterative name of that law,

											doing the same job,
being equally qualified,

are physically stronger.

											Some weeks ago, I walked into a lobby
of one of the best Nigerian hotels.

focus on the ostensible supply

											Gender matters everywhere in the world,
											but I want to focus on Nigeria
											and on Africa in general,
											because it is where I know,
and because it is where my heart is.
											And I would like today to ask
											that we begin to dream about
and plan for a different world,
											a fairer world,
											a world of happier men and happier women
who are truer to themselves.
											And this is how to start:
											we must raise our daughters differently.
											We must also raise our sons differently.
											We do a great disservice to boys
on how we raise them;
											we stifle the humanity of boys.
											We define masculinity
in a very narrow way,
											masculinity becomes this hard, small cage
											and we put boys inside the cage.
											We teach boys to be afraid of fear.
											We teach boys to be afraid
of weakness, of vulnerability.
											We teach them to mask their true selves,
											because they have to be,
in Nigerian speak, &quot;hard man!&quot;
											In secondary school, a boy and a girl,
both of them teenagers,
											both of them with the same amount
of pocket money, would go out
											and then the boy
would be expected always to pay,
											to prove his masculinity.
											And yet we wonder why boys are more likely
to steal money from their parents.

											What if both boys and girls were raised
											not to link masculinity with money?
											What if the attitude
was not &quot;the boy has to pay&quot;
											but rather &quot;whoever has more should pay?&quot;
											Now, of course because
of that historical advantage,
											it is mostly men who will have more today,
											but if we start
raising children differently,
											then in fifty years, in a hundred years,
											boys will no longer have the pressure
of having to prove this masculinity.
											But by far the worst thing we do to males,
											by making them feel
that they have to be hard,
											is that we leave them
with very fragile egos.
											The more &quot;hard man&quot;
the man feels compelled to be,
											the weaker his ego is.
											And then we do a much greater
disservice to girls
											because we raise them
to cater to the fragile egos of men.
											We teach girls to shrink themselves,
to make themselves smaller,
											we say to girls,
											&quot;You can have ambition, but not too much.&quot;

would be intimidated by me.
											I was not worried at all.
											In fact, it had not occurred
to me to be worried

be intimidated by me
											is exactly the kind of man
I would have no interest in.

was gang raped in a university in Nigeria,

											&quot;Yes, rape is wrong.

to think of women as inherently guilty,

to expect so little of men

											We teach girls shame.

											Some people will say,

											And for non-Nigerians,
bottom power is an expression

something like a woman
											who uses her sexuality
to get favors from men.
											But bottom power is not power at all.
											Bottom power means that a woman
											simply has a good root to tap into,
from time to time —
											somebody else&#39;s power.

that somebody else is in a bad mood,

											I am a feminist.
											And when I looked up the word
in the dictionary that day,

											&quot;Feminist: a person
who believes in the social, political

											My great grandmother,
from the stories I&#39;ve heard,

											She ran away from the house of the man
she did not want to marry
