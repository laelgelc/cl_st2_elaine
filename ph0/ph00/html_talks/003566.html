											I have spent the past few years
											putting myself into situations
											that are usually very difficult
											and at the same time somewhat dangerous.
											I went to prison —
											difficult.
											I worked in a coal mine —
											dangerous.
											I filmed in war zones —
											difficult and dangerous.
											And I spent 30 days eating nothing but this —
											fun in the beginning,
											little difficult in the middle, very dangerous in the end.
											In fact, most of my career,
											I&#39;ve been immersing myself
											into seemingly horrible situations
											for the whole goal of trying
											to examine societal issues
											in a way that make them engaging, that make them interesting,
											that hopefully break them down in a way
											that make them entertaining and accessible to an audience.
											So when I knew I was coming here
											to do a TED Talk that was going to look at the world of branding and sponsorship,
											I knew I would want to do something a little different.

											So as some of you may or may not have heard,
											a couple weeks ago, I took out an ad on eBay.
											I sent out some Facebook messages,
											some Twitter messages,
											and I gave people the opportunity to buy the naming rights
											to my 2011 TED Talk.
											(Laughter)
											That&#39;s right, some lucky individual, corporation,
											for-profit or non-profit,
											was going to get the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity —
											because I&#39;m sure Chris Anderson will never let it happen again —
											(Laughter)
											to buy the naming rights
											to the talk you&#39;re watching right now,
											that at the time didn&#39;t have a title, didn&#39;t really have a lot of content
											and didn&#39;t really give much hint
											as to what the subject matter would actually be.
											So what you were getting was this:
											Your name here presents:
											My TED Talk that you have no idea what the subject is
											and, depending on the content, could ultimately blow up in your face,
											especially if I make you or your company look stupid for doing it.
											But that being said,
											it&#39;s a very good media opportunity.
											(Laughter)
											You know how many people watch these TED Talks?
											It&#39;s a lot.
											That&#39;s just a working title, by the way.
											(Laughter)
											So even with that caveat,
											I knew that someone would buy the naming rights.

											Now if you&#39;d have asked me that a year ago,
											I wouldn&#39;t have been able to tell you that with any certainty.
											But in the new project that I&#39;m working on, my new film,
											we examine the world of marketing, advertising.
											And as I said earlier,
											I put myself in some pretty horrible situations over the years,
											but nothing could prepare me, nothing could ready me,
											for anything as difficult
											or as dangerous
											as going into the rooms with these guys.
											(Laughter)
											You see, I had this idea for a movie.

											(Video) Morgan Spurlock: What I want to do is make a film
											all about product placement, marketing and advertising,
											where the entire film is funded
											by product placement, marketing and advertising.
											So the movie will be called &quot;The Greatest Movie Ever Sold.&quot;
											So what happens in &quot;The Greatest Movie Ever Sold,&quot;
											is that everything from top to bottom, from start to finish,
											is branded from beginning to end —
											from the above-the-title sponsor that you&#39;ll see in the movie,
											which is brand X.
											Now this brand, the Qualcomm Stadium,
											the Staples Center ...
											these people will be married to the film in perpetuity — forever.
											And so the film explores this whole idea — (Michael Kassan: It&#39;s redundant.)
											It&#39;s what? (MK: It&#39;s redundant.) In perpetuity, forever?
											I&#39;m a redundant person. (MK: I&#39;m just saying.)
											That was more for emphasis.
											It was, &quot;In perpetuity. Forever.&quot;
											But not only are we going to have the brand X title sponsor,
											but we&#39;re going to make sure we sell out every category we can in the film.
											So maybe we sell a shoe and it becomes the greatest shoe you ever wore ...
											the greatest car you ever drove from &quot;The Greatest Movie Ever Sold,&quot;
											the greatest drink you&#39;ve ever had, courtesy of &quot;The Greatest Movie Ever Sold.&quot;

											to get as many people to see it as possible.
											Especially in today&#39;s world,
											this intersection of new media and old media

											this is —-
											(Laughter)
											(Applause)
											This is one of the first images that comes up.
											So I like the way you roll, Sergey Brin. No.
											(Laughter)
											This is was the problem: transparency —
											free from pretense or deceit;
											easily detected or seen through;
											readily understood;
											characterized by visibility or accessibility of information,
											especially concerning business practices —
											that last line being probably the biggest problem.
											You see, we hear a lot about transparency these days.
											Our politicians say it, our president says it,
											even our CEO&#39;s say it.
											But suddenly when it comes down to becoming a reality,
											something suddenly changes.
											But why? Well, transparency is scary —
											(Roar)
											like that odd, still-screaming bear.
											(Laughter)
											It&#39;s unpredictable —
											(Music)
											(Laughter)
											like this odd country road.
											And it&#39;s also very risky.

											Now when I started talking to companies
											and telling them that we wanted to tell this story,
											and they said, &quot;No, we want you to tell a story.
											We want you to tell a story,
											but we just want to tell our story.&quot;
											See, when I was a kid
											and my father would catch me in some sort of a lie —
											and there he is giving me the look he often gave me —
											he would say, &quot;Son, there&#39;s three sides to every story.
											There&#39;s your story,
											there&#39;s my story
											and there&#39;s the real story.&quot;
											Now you see, with this film, we wanted to tell the real story.
											But with only one company, one agency willing to help me —
											and that&#39;s only because I knew John Bond and Richard Kirshenbaum for years —
											I realized that I would have to go on my own,
											I&#39;d have to cut out the middleman
											and go to the companies myself with all of my team.
											So what you suddenly started to realize —
											or what I started to realize —
											is that when you started having conversations with these companies,
											the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.

											Lindsay Zaltman: The first thing we saw was this idea
											that you had two distinct, but complementary
											sides to your brand personality —
											the Morgan Spurlock brand is a mindful/play brand.
											Those are juxtaposed very nicely together.
											And I think there&#39;s almost a paradox with those.
											And I think some companies
											will just focus on one of their strengths or the other
											instead of focusing on both.
											Most companies tend to — and it&#39;s human nature —
											to avoid things that they&#39;re not sure of,
											avoid fear, those elements,
											and you really embrace those,
											and you actually turn them into positives for you, and it&#39;s a neat thing to see.
											What other brands are like that?
											The first on here is the classic, Apple.
											And you can see here too, Target, Wii,
											Mini from the Mini Coopers, and JetBlue.
											Now there&#39;s playful brands and mindful brands,
											those things that have come and gone,
											but a playful, mindful brand is a pretty powerful thing.

											MS: A playful, mindful brand. What is your brand?
											If somebody asked you to describe your brand identity, your brand personality,
											what would you be?
											Are you an up attribute? Are you something that gets the blood flowing?
											Or are you more of a down attribute?
											Are you something that&#39;s a little more calm, reserved, conservative?
											Up attributes are things like being playful,
											being fresh like the Fresh Prince,
											contemporary, adventurous,
											edgy or daring like Errol Flynn,
											nimble or agile, profane, domineering,
											magical or mystical like Gandalf.
											Or are you more of a down attribute?
											Are you mindful, sophisticated like 007?
											Are you established, traditional, nurturing, protective,
											empathetic like the Oprah?
											Are you reliable, stable, familiar,
											safe, secure, sacred,
											contemplative or wise
											like the Dalai Lama or Yoda?

											Over the course of this film,

											They wanted nothing to do with this film, mainly because they would have no control,

											But we did get 17 brand partners
											who were willing to relinquish that control,
											who wanted to be in business
											with someone as mindful and as playful as myself
											and who ultimately empowered us to tell stories
											that normally we wouldn&#39;t be able to tell —

											(Applause)
											And we went to school districts
											where now companies are making their way
											into cash-strapped schools all across America.
											What&#39;s incredible for me is the projects that I&#39;ve gotten the most feedback out of,

											Well, since the film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival, let&#39;s take a look.
											According to Burrelles, the movie premiered in January,
											and since then — and this isn&#39;t even the whole thing —
											we&#39;ve had 900 million media impressions for this film.
											That&#39;s literally covering just like a two and a half-week period.

											The film hasn&#39;t even been distributed yet.
											It&#39;s not even online. It&#39;s not even streaming.
											It&#39;s not even been out into other foreign countries yet.
											So ultimately,

											And not bad for a project that almost every ad agency we talked to
											advised their clients not to take part.

											What I always believe

											I feel like that what has to happen moving forward
											is we need to encourage people to take risks.
											We need to encourage people to not be afraid
											of opportunities that may scare them.
											Ultimately, moving forward,

And &quot;host&quot; can be taken literally: eating only McDonald&#39;s for 30 days straight, Spurlock went into a shocking physical and emotional decline, showing via his own body the truth about junk food.

Stories from <em>30 Days</em> are human, engaging, surprising: An anti-immigrant activist warms to a tight-knit family of border-crossers; an outsourced US engineer meets the Indian engineer who holds his old job; a former pro football player spends 30 days navigating the world in a wheelchair.</p><p>In 2008, Spurlock released&nbsp;<em><a href=\"http://geni.us/whereintheworld\" target=\"_blank\">Where in the World Is Osama Bin Laden?</a>,</em>&nbsp;about his months-long trek through Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Israel, Palestine ... following leads and interviewing people along the way. (In an interview, he guessed he got within 50 miles of Osama before winding up the hunt.) He was also part of a group-filmed version of <em>Freakonomics</em>. He wrote a book about his fast-food odyssey, called&nbsp;<a href=\"http://geni.us/donteatthisbook\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Don&#39;t Eat This Book</em></a>&nbsp;-- while his wife, vegan chef Alex Jamieson, wrote a bestseller about the eight-week cleansing diet she put Spurlock on after he got supersized.</p><p>His latest film,&nbsp;<em><a href=\"http://geni.us/greatestmovieever\" target=\"_blank\">The Greatest Movie Ever Sold</a>,</em>&nbsp;dives into the  mysterious world of brand sponsorship, a major influence on how pop culture is developed and shared. Almost  totally sponsored itself, the film was the first to be sold at Sundance 2011,  and, it&#39;s said, made a profit before it even opened.

Stories from <em>30 Days</em> are human, engaging, surprising: An anti-immigrant activist warms to a tight-knit family of border-crossers; an outsourced US engineer meets the Indian engineer who holds his old job; a former pro football player spends 30 days navigating the world in a wheelchair.</p><p>In 2008, Spurlock released&nbsp;<em><a href=\"http://geni.us/whereintheworld\" target=\"_blank\">Where in the World Is Osama Bin Laden?</a>,</em>&nbsp;about his months-long trek through Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Israel, Palestine ... following leads and interviewing people along the way. (In an interview, he guessed he got within 50 miles of Osama before winding up the hunt.) He was also part of a group-filmed version of <em>Freakonomics</em>. He wrote a book about his fast-food odyssey, called&nbsp;<a href=\"http://geni.us/donteatthisbook\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Don&#39;t Eat This Book</em></a>&nbsp;-- while his wife, vegan chef Alex Jamieson, wrote a bestseller about the eight-week cleansing diet she put Spurlock on after he got supersized.</p><p>His latest film,&nbsp;<em><a href=\"http://geni.us/greatestmovieever\" target=\"_blank\">The Greatest Movie Ever Sold</a>,</em>&nbsp;dives into the  mysterious world of brand sponsorship, a major influence on how pop culture is developed and shared. Almost  totally sponsored itself, the film was the first to be sold at Sundance 2011,  and, it&#39;s said, made a profit before it even opened. The film debuts in  US theaters on April 22, 2011.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"}],"speaker_name":"Morgan Spurlock","tags":["Brand","business","consumerism","film","humor","comedy","movies"],"title":"The greatest TED Talk ever sold","video_type":{"id":"1","name":"TED Stage Talk"},"viewed_count":2407045}]}})</script></div>
