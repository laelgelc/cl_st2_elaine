											that work was good mathematics.

it happened to apply to physics,

											JS: Well, that&#39;s a ball — it&#39;s a sphere,
and it has a lattice around it —
											you know, those squares.
											What I&#39;m going to show here was
originally observed by [Leonhard] Euler,
											the great mathematician, in the 1700s.
											And it gradually grew to be
a very important field in mathematics:
											algebraic topology, geometry.
											That paper up there had its roots in this.
											So, here&#39;s this thing:
											it has eight vertices,
12 edges, six faces.
											And if you look at the difference —
vertices minus edges plus faces —
											you get two.
											OK, well, two. That&#39;s a good number.
											Here&#39;s a different way of doing it —
these are triangles covering —
											this has 12 vertices and 30 edges
											and 20 faces, 20 tiles.
											And vertices minus edges
plus faces still equals two.
											And in fact, you could do this
any which way —
											cover this thing with all kinds
of polygons and triangles
											and mix them up.
											And you take vertices minus edges
plus faces — you&#39;ll get two.
											Here&#39;s a different shape.
											This is a torus, or the surface
of a doughnut: 16 vertices
											covered by these rectangles,
32 edges, 16 faces.
											Vertices minus edges comes out to be zero.
											It&#39;ll always come out to zero.
											Every time you cover a torus
with squares or triangles
											or anything like that,
you&#39;re going to get zero.
											So, this is called
the Euler characteristic.
											And it&#39;s what&#39;s called
a topological invariant.
											It&#39;s pretty amazing.
											No matter how you do it,
you&#39;re always get the same answer.
											So that was the first sort of thrust,
from the mid-1700s,
											into a subject which is now called
algebraic topology.

											and model it sort of combinatorially,

											CA: Jim, here&#39;s another project
that you&#39;ve supported philanthropically:
											Research into origins of life, I guess.
											What are we looking at here?
											JS: Well, I&#39;ll save that for a second.
											And then I&#39;ll tell you
what you&#39;re looking at.
											Origins of life is a fascinating question.
											How did we get here?
											Well, there are two questions:
											One is, what is the route
from geology to biology —
											how did we get here?
											And the other question is,
what did we start with?
											What material, if any,
did we have to work with on this route?
											Those are two very,
very interesting questions.
											The first question is a tortuous path
from geology up to RNA
											or something like that —
how did that all work?
											And the other,
what do we have to work with?
											Well, more than we think.
											So what&#39;s pictured there
is a star in formation.
											Now, every year in our Milky Way,
which has 100 billion stars,
											about two new stars are created.
											Don&#39;t ask me how, but they&#39;re created.
											And it takes them about a million
years to settle out.
											So, in steady state,
											there are about two million stars
in formation at any time.
											That one is somewhere
along this settling-down period.
											And there&#39;s all this crap
sort of circling around it,
											dust and stuff.
											And it&#39;ll form probably a solar system,
or whatever it forms.
											But here&#39;s the thing —
											in this dust that surrounds a forming star
											have been found, now,
significant organic molecules.
											Molecules not just like methane,
but formaldehyde and cyanide —
											things that are the building blocks —
the seeds, if you will — of life.
											So, that may be typical.
											And it may be typical
that planets around the universe
											start off with some of these
basic building blocks.
											Now does that mean
there&#39;s going to be life all around?
											Maybe.
											But it&#39;s a question
of how tortuous this path is
											from those frail beginnings,
those seeds, all the way to life.
											And most of those seeds
will fall on fallow planets.
