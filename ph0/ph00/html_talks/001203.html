<title>Azim Khamisa and Ples Felix: What comes after tragedy? Forgiveness | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: On one awful night in 1995, Ples Felix&#39;s 14-year-old grandson murdered Azim Khamisa&#39;s son in a gang initiation fueled by drugs, alcohol and a false sense of belonging. The deadly encounter sent Khamisa and Felix down paths of deep meditation, to forgive and to be forgiven -- and in an act of bravery and reconciliation, the two men met and forged a lasting bond. Together, they&#39;ve used their story as an outline for a better, more merciful society, where victims of tragedy can grow and heal. Prepare to be moved by their unimaginable story. &quot;Peace is possible,&quot; Khamisa says. &quot;How do I know that? Because I am at peace.&quot;" />

<meta content='What comes after tragedy? Forgiveness' itemprop='name'>
<meta content='On one awful night in 1995, Ples Felix&#x0027;s 14-year-old grandson murdered Azim Khamisa&#x0027;s son in a gang initiation fueled by drugs, alcohol and a false sense of belonging. The deadly encounter sent Khamisa and Felix down paths of deep meditation, to forgive and to be forgiven — and in an act of bravery and reconciliation, the two men met and forged a lasting bond. Together, they&#x0027;ve used their story as an outline for a better, more merciful society, where victims of tragedy can grow and heal. Prepare to be moved by their unimaginable story. "Peace is possible," Khamisa says. "How do I know that? Because I am at peace."' itemprop='description'>

											Azim Khamisa: We humans
have many defining moments in our lives.
											Sometimes these moments are joyous,
											and sometimes they are heartbreaking,
											tragic.
											But at these defining moments,
if we are able to make the right choice,
											we literally manifest a miracle
											in us and others.

											My only son Tariq, a university student,
											kind, generous, a good writer,
a good photographer,
											had aspirations
to work for National Geographic,
											engaged to a beautiful lady,
											worked as a pizza deliveryman
on Fridays and Saturdays.
											He was lured to a bogus address
											by a youth gang.
											And in a gang initiation,
											a 14-year-old shot and killed him.
											The sudden, senseless death
											of an innocent, unarmed human being;
											the overwhelming grief of a family;
											the total confusion as you try
to absorb a new, hideous reality.
											Needless to say it brought
my life to a crashing halt.
											One of the hardest things
I&#39;ve ever had to do
											was to call his mother,
who lived in a different city.
											How do you tell a mother
she&#39;s never going to see her son again,
											or hear him laugh,
											or give him a hug?

											I practice as a Sufi Muslim.
											I meditate two hours a day.
											And sometimes,
											in deep trauma and deep tragedy,
											there is a spark of clarity.
											So what I downloaded in my meditation
											is that there were victims
at both ends of the gun.
											It&#39;s easy to see that my son
was a victim of the 14-year-old,
											a little bit complicated to see
that he was a victim of American society.
											And that begs the question,
well, who is American society?
											Well, it&#39;s you and me,
											because I don&#39;t believe
that society is just happenstance.
											I think we are all responsible
for the society we&#39;ve created.
											And children killing children
is not a mark of a civil society.

											So nine months after Tariq died,
											I started the Tariq Khamisa Foundation
											and our mandate
at the Tariq Khamisa Foundation
											is to stop kids from killing kids
											by breaking the cycle of youth violence.
											And essentially we have three mandates.
											Our first and foremost
is to save lives of children.
											It&#39;s important to do.
We lose so many on a daily basis.
											Our second mandate
											is to empower the right choices
so kids don&#39;t fall through the cracks
											and choose lives of gangs and crime
and drugs and alcohol and weapons.
											And our third mandate is to teach
the principles of nonviolence,
											of empathy, of compassion,
											of forgiveness.

											And I started with a very simple premise
											that violence is a learned behavior.
											No child was born violent.
											If you accept that as a truism,
											nonviolence can also be
a learned behavior,
											but you have to teach it,
											because kids are not going to learn that
											through osmosis.

											Soon after that,
I reached out to my brother here,
											with the attitude
that we had both lost a son.
											My son died.
											He lost his grandson
to the adult prison system.
											And I asked him to join me.
											As you see, 22 years later,
we are still here together,
											because I can&#39;t bring Tariq
back from the dead,
											you can&#39;t take Tony out of prison,
											but the one thing we can do
											is make sure no other young people
in our community
											end up dead or end up in prison.

these principles of nonviolence,

											Five years after Tariq died,
											and for me to complete
my journey of forgiveness,
											I went to see the young man
who killed my son.
											He was 19 years old.
											And I remember that meeting
because we were —
											he&#39;s 37, still in prison —
											but at that first meeting,
we locked eyeballs.
											I&#39;m looking in his eyes,
he&#39;s looking in my eyes,
											and I&#39;m looking in his eyes
trying to find a murderer, and I didn&#39;t.
											I was able to climb through his eyes
											and touch his humanity that I got
											that the spark in him
was no different than the spark in me
											or anybody else here.
											So I wasn&#39;t expecting that.
He was remorseful.
											He was articulate. He was well-mannered.
											And I could tell that my hand
of forgiveness had changed him.

											Ples Felix: Tony is my one

											Tony was born to my daughter,

											Mothering is the toughest
job on the planet.
											There is no tougher job on the planet
than raising another human being
											and making sure they&#39;re safe, secure
											and well-positioned
to be successful in life.
											Tony experienced a lot of violence
in his life as a young kid.
											He saw one of his favorite cousins
											be murdered in a hail
of automatic weapon fire
											and gang involvement in Los Angeles.
											He was very traumatized
in so many different ways.

Tony ran away from home that evening,

they would make him feel carefree.
											But all it did was
to make his anxiety go higher

											It was very helpful for me
											because it offered me an opportunity
to seek guidance and clarity
											about how I wanted to be of support
of this man and his family in this loss.
											And sure enough, my prayers were answered,
											because I was invited
to a meeting at this man&#39;s house,
											met his mother, his father,
											his wife, his brother, met their family
											and had a chance to be in the presence
of God-spirited people led by this man,
											who in the spirit of forgiveness,
											made way, made an opportunity for me
											to be of value and to share with him
and to share with children
											the importance of understanding the need
to be with a responsible adult,
											focus on your anger
in a way that&#39;s healthy,
											learn to meditate.
											The programs that we have
in the Tariq Khamisa Foundation
											provide so many tools
for the kids to put in their toolkit
											so they could carry them
throughout their lives.
											It&#39;s important that our children
understand that loving, caring adults
											care for them and support them,
											but it&#39;s also important
that our children learn to meditate,
											learn to be peaceful,
											learn to be centered
											and learn to interact
with the other children
											in a kind, empathetic
											and wonderfully loving way.
											We need more love in our society
											and that&#39;s why we are here
to share the love with children,
											because our children
will lead the way for us,
											because all of us
will depend on our children.
											As we grow older and retire,
they will take over this world for us,
											so as much love as we teach them,
they will give it back to us.

											So it goes like this:
sustained goodwill creates friendship.
											You don&#39;t make friends
by bombing them, right?
											You make friends by extending goodwill.
											That ought to be obvious.
											So sustained goodwill creates friendship,
											sustained friendship creates trust,
											sustained trust creates empathy,
											sustained empathy creates compassion,
											and sustained compassion creates peace.
											I call this my peace formula.
											It starts with goodwill, friendship,
trust, empathy, compassion and peace.

how do you extend goodwill

											it can work for you and your family,
