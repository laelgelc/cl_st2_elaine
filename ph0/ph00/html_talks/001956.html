<title>António Guterres: Refugees have the right to be protected | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: António Guterres thinks that we can solve the global refugee crisis -- and he offers compelling, surprising reasons why we must try. In conversation with TED&#39;s Bruno Giussani, Guterres discusses the historical causes of the current crisis and outlines the mood of the European countries that are trying to screen, shelter and resettle hundreds of thousands of desperate families. Bigger picture: Guterres calls for a multilateral turn toward acceptance and respect -- to defy groups like ISIS&#39;s anti-refugee propaganda and recruiting machine." />

<meta content="António Guterres thinks that we can solve the global refugee crisis — and he offers compelling, surprising reasons why we must try. In conversation with TED's Bruno Giussani, Guterres discusses the historical causes of the current crisis and outlines the mood of the European countries that are trying to screen, shelter and resettle hundreds of thousands of desperate families. Bigger picture: Guterres calls for a multilateral turn toward acceptance and respect — to defy groups like ISIS's anti-refugee propaganda and recruiting machine." itemprop='description'>

											BG: Let&#39;s start with a figure.
											During 2015, almost one million refugees
and migrants arrived in Europe
											from many different countries,
											of course, from Syria and Iraq,
but also from Afghanistan
											and Bangladesh and Eritrea and elsewhere.
											And there have been reactions
of two different kinds:
											welcoming parties and border fences.
											But I want to look at it a little bit
											from the short-term
and the long-term perspective.
											And the first question is very simple:
											Why has the movement of refugees
spiked so fast in the last six months?
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											AG: Well, I think, basically,
what triggered this huge increase
											was the Syrian refugee group.
											There has been an increased movement
into Europe from Africa, from Asia,
											but slowly growing, and all of a sudden
we had this massive increase
											in the first months of this year.
											Why? I think there are three reasons,
											two long-term ones and the trigger.
											The long-term ones,
in relation to Syrians,
											is that hope is less and less
clear for people.
											I mean, they look at their own country
											and they don&#39;t see much hope
to go back home,
											because there is no political solution,
											so there is no light
at the end of the tunnel.
											Second, the living conditions
											of the Syrians in the neighboring
countries have been deteriorating.
											We just had research with the World Bank,
											and 87 percent of the Syrians in Jordan
											and 93 percent of the Syrians in Lebanon
											live below the national poverty lines.
											Only half of the children go to school,
											which means that people
are living very badly.
											Not only are they refugees, out of home,
											not only have they suffered
what they have suffered,
											but they are living in very,
very dramatic conditions.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And then the trigger
was when all of a sudden,
											international aid decreased.
											The World Food Programme was forced,
for lack of resources,
											to cut by 30 percent food support
to the Syrian refugees.
											They&#39;re not allowed to work,
											so they are totally dependent
on international support,
											and they felt, &quot;The world
is abandoning us.&quot;
											And that, in my opinion, was the trigger.
											All of a sudden, there was a rush,
											and people started to move
in large numbers
											and, to be absolutely honest,
											if I had been in the same situation
											and I would have been brave
enough to do it,
											I think I would have done the same.

											BG: But I think what surprised
many people is it&#39;s not only sudden,
											but it wasn&#39;t supposed to be sudden.
											The war in Syria has been
happening for five years.
											Millions of refugees are in camps
and villages and towns around Syria.
											You have yourself warned
about the situation
											and about the consequences
of a breakdown of Libya, for example,
											and yet Europe looked totally unprepared.

									<p>
											AG: Well, unprepared because divided,
											and when you are divided,
you don&#39;t want to recognize the reality.
											You prefer to postpone decisions,
											because you do not have
the capacity to make them.
											And the proof is that even when
the spike occurred,
											Europe remained divided
											and was unable to put in place
a mechanism to manage the situation.
											You talk about one million people.
											It looks enormous,
											but the population of the European Union
is 550 million people,
											which means we are talking about one
per every [550] Europeans.
											Now, in Lebanon, we have one refugee
per three Lebanese.
											And Lebanon? Struggling,
of course, but it&#39;s managing.
											So, the question is: is this something
that could have been managed
											if — not mentioning the most
important thing,
											which would have been
addressing the root causes,
											but forgetting about root causes for now,
											looking at the phenomenon as it is —
											if Europe were able to come
together in solidarity
											to create an adequate
reception capacity of entry points?
											But for that, the countries at entry
points need to be massively supported,
											and then screening the people
with security checks
											and all the other mechanisms,
											distributing those that are coming
into all European countries,
											according to the possibilities
of each country.
											I mean, if you look at
the relocation program
											that was approved by the Commission,
always too little too late,
											or by the Council, too little too late —

the pressure is at the point of entry,

											BG: Let me try to bring up
three questions,
											playing a bit devil&#39;s advocate.
											I&#39;ll try to ask them, make them blunt.
											But I think the questions are very present
											in the minds of many people
in Europe right now,
											The first, of course, is about numbers.
											You say 550 million versus one million
is not much, but realistically,
											how many people can Europe take?

											AG: Well, that is a question
that has no answer,
											because refugees have
the right to be protected.
											And there is such a thing
as international law,
											so there is no way you can say,
&quot;I take 10,000 and that&#39;s finished.&quot;
											I remind you of one thing:
											in Turkey, at the beginning of the crisis,
I remember one minister saying,
											&quot;Turkey will be able to receive
up to 100,000 people.&quot;
											Turkey has now two million
three-hundred thousand

if you count all refugees.

											So I don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair to say
how many we can take.
											What it is fair to say is:
how we can we organize ourselves
											to assume our international
responsibilities?
											And Europe has not been able to do so,
											because basically, Europe is divided
because there is no solidarity
											in the European project.
											And it&#39;s not only about refugees;
there are many other areas.
											And let&#39;s be honest, this is the moment
in which we need more Europe
											instead of less Europe.
											But as the public less and less believes
in European institutions,
											it is also each time more difficult
to convince the public
											that we need more Europe
to solve these problems.

											AG: But, if I may, on these:
											I mean, what does a European see at home
											in a village where there are no migrants?
											What a European sees is, on television,
											every single day, a few months ago,
opening the news every single day,
											a crowd coming, uncontrolled,
											moving from border to border,
											and the images on television
were of hundreds
											or thousands of people moving.
											And the idea is that nobody
is taking care of it —
											this is happening without any
kind of management.
											And so their idea was,
&quot;They are coming to my village.&quot;
											So there was this completely false idea
that Europe was being invaded
											and our way of life is going to change,
and everything will —
											And the problem is that if this
had been properly managed,
											if people had been properly received,
											welcomed, sheltered at point of entry,
screened at point of entry,

to different European countries,

management of the situation

the percentage that I mentioned:
											one per each 2,000.
											It is because things are not
properly managed
											that in the end we have situations
											that are totally impossible to live with,
and of course if you have a village —
											in Lebanon, there are many villages
											that have more Syrians than Lebanese;
Lebanon has been living with that.

to happen in Europe,

more refugees than inhabitants.

											AG: Well, it&#39;s not only Donald Trump.
											We have seen several people
around the world
											with political responsibility
saying, for instance,
											that Muslims refugees
should not be received.
											And the reason why they say this
											is because they think
that by doing or saying this,
											they are protecting
the security of their countries.
											Now, I&#39;ve been in government.
											I am very keen on the need for governments
											to protect the security of their countries
											and their people.
											But if you say, like that,
											in the US or in any European country,
											&quot;We are going to close our doors
to Muslim refugees,&quot;
											what you are saying
is the best possible help
											for the propaganda
of terrorist organizations.
											Because what you are saying —

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">

											What you are saying will be heard
by all the Muslims in your own country,
											and it will pave the way
for the recruitment
											and the mechanisms that,
through technology,
											Daesh and al-Nusra, al-Qaeda,
and all those other groups
											are today penetrating in our societies.
											And it&#39;s just telling them,
&quot;You are right, we are against you.&quot;
											So obviously, this is creating
in societies that are all multiethnic,
											multi-religious, multicultural,
											this is creating a situation
in which, really,
											it is much easier for the propaganda
of these terrorist organizations
											to be effective in recruiting
people for terror acts

											AG: In the sense that, I mean,
for many people the first reaction

attacks is: close all borders —
											not understanding that the terrorist
problem in Europe is largely homegrown.
											We have thousands and thousands
of European fighters in Syria and in Iraq,

											AG: [I believe] it was on purpose,
											because part of the strategies
of Daesh is against refugees,
											because they see refugees as people
that should be with the caliphate
											and are fleeing to the crusaders.
											And I think that is part of Daesh&#39;s
strategy to make Europe react,
											closing its doors to Muslim refugees
											and having an hostility
towards Muslims inside Europe,
											exactly to facilitate Daesh&#39;s work.

									<p>
											And my deep belief is that
it was not the refugee movement
											that triggered terrorism.
											I think, as I said,
											essentially terrorism in Europe
is today a homegrown movement
											in relation to the global situation
that we are facing,
											and what we need is exactly
to prove these groups wrong,
											by welcoming and integrating effectively
											those that are coming
from that part of the world.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And another thing that I believe
is that to a large extent,
											what we are today paying for in Europe
											is the failures of integration models
											that didn&#39;t work in the &#39;60s,
in the &#39;70s, in the &#39;80s,
											in relation to big migration flows
that took place at that time
											and generated what is today
in many of the people, for instance,
											of the second generation of communities,
											a situation of feeling marginalized,
											having no jobs,
											having improper education,
											living in some of the neighborhoods
that are not adequately provided
											by public infrastructure.
											And this kind of uneasiness,
sometimes even anger,
											that exists in this second generation
											is largely due to the failure
of integration policies,
											to the failure of what should have been
a much stronger investment
											in creating the conditions for people
to live together and respect each other.
											For me it is clear.

											For me it is clear that all societies
will be multiethnic, multicultural,

											To try to avoid it is,
in my opinion, impossible.
											And for me it&#39;s a good thing
that they will be like that,
											but I also recognize that,
for that to work properly,
											you need a huge investment
											in the social cohesion
of your own societies.

failed in that investment

											AG: Well, look:
											In 2005, we were helping
one million people go back home
											in safety and dignity,
because conflicts had ended.
											Last year, we helped 124,000.
											In 2005, we had about 38 million people
displaced by conflict in the world.
											Today, we have more than 60 million.
											At that time, we had had, recently,
											some conflicts that were solved.
											Now, we see a multiplication
of new conflicts
											and the old conflicts never died:
											Afghanistan, Somalia,
Democratic Republic of Congo.
											It is clear that the world today
is much more dangerous than it was.
											It is clear that the capacity
of the international community
											to prevent conflicts
and to timely solve them,
											is, unfortunately, much worse
than what it was 10 years ago.
											There are no clear
power relations in the world,
											no global governance mechanisms that work,
											which means that we live in a situation
											where impunity and unpredictability
tend to prevail, and that means
											that more and more people suffer,

In October 2016 the United Nations Security Council announced he would be the next United Nations Secretary General, succeeding the retiring Ban Ki-moon.</p> <p class=\"p1\">As High Commissioner, he heads one of the world&#39;s foremost humanitarian organizations. UNHCR has twice won the Nobel Peace Prize. Its over 9,300 staff members work in 123 countries providing protection and assistance to nearly 55 million refugees, returnees, internally displaced people and stateless persons. Some 88 percent of UNHCR staff work in the field, often in difficult and dangerous duty stations.</p> <p class=\"p1\">Before joining UNHCR, Guterres spent more than 20 years in government and public service. He served as Portuguese prime minister from 1995 to 2002, during which time he was heavily involved in the international effort to resolve the crisis in East Timor. As president of the European Council in early 2000, he led the adoption of the so-called Lisbon Agenda and co-chaired the first European Union-Africa summit. He also founded the Portuguese Refugee Council in 1991 and was part of the Council of State of Portugal from 1991 to 2002.</p> <p class=\"p1\">From 1981 to 1983, Guterres was a member of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, as well as chairman of the Committee on Demography, Migration and Refugees. In addition, he has been active in Socialist International, a worldwide organization of social democratic political parties. He was the group&#39;s vice-president from 1992 to 1999 and president from 1999 until mid-2005.</p> <p class=\"p1\">Guterres was born on April 30, 1949, in Lisbon and educated at the Instituto Superior T&eacute;cnico, where he remains a visiting professor.

In October 2016 the United Nations Security Council announced he would be the next United Nations Secretary General, succeeding the retiring Ban Ki-moon.</p> <p class=\"p1\">As High Commissioner, he heads one of the world&#39;s foremost humanitarian organizations. UNHCR has twice won the Nobel Peace Prize. Its over 9,300 staff members work in 123 countries providing protection and assistance to nearly 55 million refugees, returnees, internally displaced people and stateless persons. Some 88 percent of UNHCR staff work in the field, often in difficult and dangerous duty stations.</p> <p class=\"p1\">Before joining UNHCR, Guterres spent more than 20 years in government and public service. He served as Portuguese prime minister from 1995 to 2002, during which time he was heavily involved in the international effort to resolve the crisis in East Timor. As president of the European Council in early 2000, he led the adoption of the so-called Lisbon Agenda and co-chaired the first European Union-Africa summit. He also founded the Portuguese Refugee Council in 1991 and was part of the Council of State of Portugal from 1991 to 2002.</p> <p class=\"p1\">From 1981 to 1983, Guterres was a member of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, as well as chairman of the Committee on Demography, Migration and Refugees. In addition, he has been active in Socialist International, a worldwide organization of social democratic political parties. He was the group&#39;s vice-president from 1992 to 1999 and president from 1999 until mid-2005.</p> <p class=\"p1\">Guterres was born on April 30, 1949, in Lisbon and educated at the Instituto Superior T&eacute;cnico, where he remains a visiting professor. He is married and has two children.</p>"}],"speaker_name":"António Guterres","tags":["Europe","future","government","global issues","immigration","humanity","interview","policy","society","social change","terrorism"],"title":"Refugees have the right to be protected","video_type":{"id":"1","name":"TED Stage Talk"},"viewed_count":1176518}]}})</script></div>
