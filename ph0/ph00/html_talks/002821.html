											About 20 years ago, I was asked by my editors at The New York Times Magazine
											to write a piece about deaf culture.
											And I was rather taken aback.
											I had thought of deafness entirely as an illness.
											Those poor people, they couldn&#39;t hear.
											They lacked hearing, and what could we do for them?
											And then I went out into the deaf world.
											I went to deaf clubs.
											I saw performances of deaf theater and of deaf poetry.
											I even went to the Miss Deaf America contest in Nashville, Tennessee
											where people complained about that slurry Southern signing.

											were saying something that was viable.
											It wasn&#39;t my culture,
											and I didn&#39;t particularly want to rush off and join it,

											Then a friend of a friend of mine had a daughter who was a dwarf.
											And when her daughter was born,
											she suddenly found herself confronting questions
											that now began to seem quite resonant to me.
											She was facing the question of what to do with this child.
											Should she say, &quot;You&#39;re just like everyone else but a little bit shorter?&quot;
											Or should she try to construct some kind of dwarf identity,
											get involved in the Little People of America,
											become aware of what was happening for dwarfs?

											And I suddenly thought,
											most deaf children are born to hearing parents.
											Those hearing parents tend to try to cure them.
											Those deaf people discover community somehow in adolescence.
											Most gay people are born to straight parents.
											Those straight parents often want them to function
											in what they think of as the mainstream world,
											and those gay people have to discover identity later on.
											And here was this friend of mine
											looking at these questions of identity with her dwarf daughter.
											And I thought, there it is again:
											A family that perceives itself to be normal
											with a child who seems to be extraordinary.
											And I hatched the idea that there are really two kinds of identity.

											There are vertical identities,

											And while some of them can be difficult,
											there&#39;s no attempt to cure them.
											You can argue that it&#39;s harder in the United States —
											our current presidency notwithstanding —
											to be a person of color.

											There are these other identities which you have to learn from a peer group.

											Read that again. This is what we hear when you mourn over our existence.
											This is what we hear when you pray for a cure —
											that your fondest wish for us
											is that someday we will cease to be
											and strangers you can love will move in behind our faces.&quot;
											It&#39;s a very extreme point of view,
											but it points to the reality that people engage with the life they have
											and they don&#39;t want to be cured or changed or eliminated.
											They want to be whoever it is that they&#39;ve come to be.

											One of the families I interviewed for this project
											was the family of Dylan Klebold who was one of the perpetrators of the Columbine massacre.
											It took a long time to persuade them to talk to me,
											and once they agreed, they were so full of their story
											that they couldn&#39;t stop telling it.
											And the first weekend I spent with them — the first of many —
											I recorded more than 20 hours of conversation.

											And his father said, &quot;I sure do.
											I&#39;d want to ask him what the hell he thought he was doing.&quot;

											When I had dinner with her a couple of years later —
											one of many dinners that we had together —
											she said, &quot;You know, when it first happened,
											I used to wish that I had never married, that I had never had children.
											If I hadn&#39;t gone to Ohio State and crossed paths with Tom,
											this child wouldn&#39;t have existed and this terrible thing wouldn&#39;t have happened.
											But I&#39;ve come to feel that I love the children I had so much
											that I don&#39;t want to imagine a life without them.
											I recognize the pain they caused to others, for which there can be no forgiveness,
											but the pain they caused to me, there is,&quot; she said.

											I thought it was surprising how all of these families had all of these children with all of these problems,
											problems that they mostly would have done anything to avoid,
											and that they had all found so much meaning in that experience of parenting.
											And then I thought, all of us who have children
											love the children we have, with their flaws.
											If some glorious angel suddenly descended through my living room ceiling
											and offered to take away the children I have
											and give me other, better children — more polite, funnier, nicer, smarter —
											I would cling to the children I have and pray away that atrocious spectacle.
											And ultimately I feel
											that in the same way that we test flame-retardant pajamas in an inferno
											to ensure they won&#39;t catch fire when our child reaches across the stove,
											so these stories of families negotiating these extreme differences
											reflect on the universal experience of parenting,
											which is always that sometimes you look at your child and you think,
											where did you come from?

											It turns out that while each of these individual differences is siloed —

											there are only so many families of children who are transgender,
											there are only so many families of prodigies —
											who also face similar challenges in many ways —

											The day after our son was born,

											He wasn&#39;t extending his legs appropriately.
											She said that might mean that he had brain damage.
											In so far as he was extending them, he was doing so asymmetrically,

											And I thought, here I had been working for years
											on a book about how much meaning people had found
											in the experience of parenting children who are disabled,
											and I didn&#39;t want to join their number.
											Because what I was encountering was an idea of illness.
											And like all parents since the dawn of time,
											I wanted to protect my child from illness.
											And I wanted also to protect myself from illness.
											And yet, I knew from the work I had done
											that if he had any of the things we were about to start testing for,
											that those would ultimately be his identity,
											and if they were his identity they would become my identity,
											that that illness was going to take a very different shape as it unfolded.
