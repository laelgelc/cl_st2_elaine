<title>Stewart Brand and Chris Anderson: Mammoths resurrected, geoengineering and other thoughts from a futurist | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Stewart Brand is a futurist, counterculturist and visionary with a very wide-ranging mind. In conversation with TED Curator Chris Anderson, Brand discusses ... just about everything: human nature, bringing back the wooly mammoth, geoengineering, rewilding and science as organized skepticism -- plus the story of an acid trip on a San Francisco rooftop in the &#39;60s that sparked a perspective-shifting idea. &quot;The story we&#39;re told is that we&#39;re the next meteor,&quot; Brand says, but &quot;things are capable of getting better.&quot;" />

<meta content='Mammoths resurrected, geoengineering and other thoughts from a futurist' itemprop='name'>
<meta content='Stewart Brand is a futurist, counterculturist and visionary with a very wide-ranging mind. In conversation with TED Curator Chris Anderson, Brand discusses ... just about everything: human nature, bringing back the wooly mammoth, geoengineering, rewilding and science as organized skepticism — plus the story of an acid trip on a San Francisco rooftop in the &#x0027;60s that sparked a perspective-shifting idea. "The story we&#x0027;re told is that we&#x0027;re the next meteor," Brand says, but "things are capable of getting better."' itemprop='description'>

											SB: Partly, I was trained to do that
as an army officer,
											but partly, it&#39;s just a cheap heuristic
to find originalities:
											don&#39;t look where everybody
else is looking,
											look the opposite way.
											So the deal with counterculture is,
the hippies were very romantic
											and kind of against technology,
											except very good LSD from Sandoz,
											and the New Left was against technology
											because they thought
it was a power device.
											Computers were: do not spindle,
fold, or mutilate.
											Fight that.
											And so, the Whole Earth Catalog
was kind of a counter-counterculture thing
											in the sense that I bought
Buckminster Fuller&#39;s idea
											that tools of are of the essence.
											Science and engineers basically
define the world in interesting ways.
											If all the politicians
disappeared one week,
											it would be ... a nuisance.
											But if all the scientists
and engineers disappeared one week,
											it would be way more than a nuisance.

											And then the New Left was talking
about power to the people.
											And people like Steve Jobs
and Steve Wozniak
											cut that and just said, power to people,
											tools that actually work.
											And so, where Fuller was saying
don&#39;t try to change human nature,
											people have been trying for a long time
and it does not even bend,
											but you can change tools very easily.
											So the efficient thing to do
if you want to make the world better
											is not try to make people behave
differently like the New Left was,
											but just give them tools
that go in the right direction.
											That was the Whole Earth Catalog.

											SB: It was kind of a chance
that in the spring of &#39;66,
											thanks to an LSD experience
on a rooftop in San Francisco,
											I got thinking about, again,
something that Fuller talked about,
											that a lot of people assume
that the Earth is flat
											and kind of infinite
in terms of its resources,
											but once you really grasp
that it&#39;s a sphere
											and that there&#39;s only so much of it,
											then you start husbanding your resources
											and thinking about it as a finite system.
											&quot;Spaceship Earth&quot; was his metaphor.
											And I wanted that to be the case,
											but on LSD I was getting higher and higher
on my hundred micrograms
											on the roof of San Francisco,
											and noticed that the downtown buildings
which were right in front of me
											were not all parallel,
they were sort of fanned out like this.
											And that&#39;s because
they are on a curved surface.
											And if I were even higher,
I would see that even more clearly,
											higher than that, more clearly still,
											higher enough, and it would close,
											and you would get
the circle of Earth from space.
											And I thought, you know, we&#39;ve been
in space for 10 years —
											at that time, this is &#39;66 —
											and the cameras had never looked back.
											They&#39;d always been looking out
or looking at just parts of the Earth.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And so I said, why haven&#39;t we seen
a photograph of the whole Earth yet?
											And it went around and NASA got it
and senators, secretaries got it,
											and various people
in the Politburo got it,
											and it went around and around.
											And within two and a half years,
											about the time the Whole Earth
Catalog came out,
											these images started to appear,
											and indeed, they did transform everything.
											And my idea of hacking civilization
											is that you try to do something
lazy and ingenious
											and just sort of trick the situation.
											So all of these photographs
that you see —
											and then the march for science last week,
											they were carrying these
Whole Earth banners and so on —
											I did that with no work.
											I sold those buttons for 25 cents apiece.
											So, you know, tweaking the system
											is, I think, not only the most efficient
way to make the system go
											in interesting ways,
											but in some ways, the safest way,
											because when you try to horse
the whole system around in a big way,
											you can get into big
horsing-around problems,
											but if you tweak it,
it will adjust to the tweak.

taking on a lot of,

											SB: Ha-ha!
											That&#39;s a National Geographic image
											of what is called the mammoth steppe,

and Arctic region, used to look like.
											In fact, the whole world
used to look like that.
											What we find in South Africa
and the Serengeti now,
											lots of big animals,
											was the case in this part of Canada,
											throughout the US, throughout Eurasia,
throughout the world.
											This was the norm

stabilization system over the long run,

there in the background

a 200-year goal.

the extinction rate

											Well, here&#39;s the deal.
											I wound up researching this
for a paper I wrote,
											that a mass extinction is when
75 percent of all the species
											in the world go extinct.
											Well, there&#39;s on the order
of five-and-a-half-million species,
											of which we&#39;ve identified
one and a half million.
											Another 14,000 are being
identified every year.
											There&#39;s a lot of biology
going on out there.
											Since 1500,
											about 500 species have gone extinct,
											and you&#39;ll see the term &quot;mass extinction&quot;
kind of used in strange ways.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So there was, about a year and a half ago,
											a front-page story by Carl Zimmer
in the New York Times,
											&quot;Mass Extinction in the Oceans,
Broad Studies Show.&quot;
											And then you read into the article,
and it mentions that since 1500,
											15 species — one, five —
have gone extinct in the oceans,
											and, oh, by the way,
none in the last 50 years.
											And you read further
into the story, and it&#39;s saying,
											the horrifying thing that&#39;s going on
											is that the fisheries
are so overfishing the wild fishes,
											that it is taking down
the fish populations in the oceans
											by 38 percent.
											That&#39;s the serious thing.
											None of those species
are probably going to go extinct.
											So you&#39;ve just put, that headline writer
											put a panic button
											on the top of the story.
											It&#39;s clickbait kind of stuff,
											but it&#39;s basically saying,
&quot;Oh my God, start panicking,
											we&#39;re going to lose
all the species in the oceans.&quot;
											Nothing like that is in prospect.
											And in fact, what I then started
looking into in a little more detail,
											the Red List shows about 23,000 species
that are considered threatened
											at one level or another,
											coming from the International Union
for the Conservation of Nature, the IUCN.
											And Nature Magazine had a piece
surveying the loss of wildlife,
											and it said,
											&quot;If all of those 23,000 went extinct
											in the next century or so,
											and that rate of extinction carried on
for more centuries and millennia,
											then we might be at the beginning
of a sixth extinction.
											So the exaggeration is way out of hand.
											But environmentalists always exaggerate.
											That&#39;s a problem.

											SB: Hmm. Asian elephants
are the closest relative

genetically very close.
											They diverged quite recently
in evolutionary history.
											The Asian elephants
are closer to woolly mammoths
											than they are to African elephants,
											but they&#39;re close enough
to African elephants
											that they have successfully hybridized.
											So we&#39;re working
with George Church at Harvard,
											who has already moved the genes
for four major traits
											from the now well-preserved, well-studied
genome of the woolly mammoth,
											thanks to so-called
&quot;ancient DNA analysis.&quot;
											And in the lab, he has moved those genes
into living Asian elephant cell lines,
											where they&#39;re taking up
their proper place thanks to CRISPR.
											I mean, they&#39;re not shooting the genes in
like you did with genetic engineering.
											Now with CRISPR you&#39;re editing,
basically, one allele,
											and replacing it in the place
of another allele.
											So you&#39;re now getting basically
Asian elephant germline cells
											that are effectively in terms
of the traits that you&#39;re going for

											Now, it&#39;s the case, so many people say,
											&quot;Well, how are you going
to get them there?
											And Asian elephants,
they don&#39;t like snow, right?&quot;
											Well, it turns out, they do like snow.
											There&#39;s some in an Ontario zoo
											that have made snowballs
bigger than people.
											They just love — you know, with a trunk,
you can start a little thing,
											roll it and make it bigger.
											And then people say,
											&quot;Yeah, but it&#39;s 22 months of gestation.
											This kind of cross-species cloning
is tricky business, anyway.
											Are you going to lose some of
the surrogate Asian elephant mothers?&quot;
											And then George Church
says, &quot;That&#39;s all right.
											We&#39;ll do an artificial uterus
and grow them that way.&quot;
											Then people say, &quot;Yeah,
next century, maybe,&quot;
											except the news came out
this week in Nature
											that there&#39;s now an artificial uterus
in which they&#39;ve grown a lamb
											to four weeks.
											That&#39;s halfway through
its gestation period.
											So this stuff is moving right along.

working on the woolly mammoth seriously:
											Revive &amp; Restore,
we&#39;re kind of in the middle;
											George Church and the group at Harvard

who has bought into the system,

Zimov have been, for 25 years,
											creating what they call
&quot;Pleistocene Park,&quot;
											which is a place in a really tough part
of Siberia that is pure tundra.
											And the research that&#39;s been done shows
											that there&#39;s probably one one-hundredth
of the animals on the landscape there
											that there used to be.
											Like that earlier image,
we saw lots of animals.
											Now there&#39;s almost none.
											The tundra is mostly moss,
and then there&#39;s the boreal forest.
											And that&#39;s the way it is, folks.
There&#39;s just a few animals there.

											So they brought in
a lot of grazing animals:
											musk ox, Yakutian horses,
they&#39;re bringing in some bison,
											they&#39;re bringing in some more now,
											and put them in at the density
that they used to be.
											And grasslands are made by grazers.
											So these animals are there, grazing away,
											and they&#39;re doing a couple of things.
											First of all, they&#39;re turning the tundra,
the moss, back into grassland.
											Grassland fixes carbon.
											Tundra, in a warming world, is thawing
and releasing a lot of carbon dioxide
											and also methane.
											So already in their little
25 square miles,
											they&#39;re doing a climate
stabilization thing.
											Part of that story, though,
											is that the boreal forest is
very absorbent to sunlight,
											even in the winter
when snow is on the ground.
											And the way the mammoth steppe,
											which used to wrap all the way
around the North Pole —
											there&#39;s a lot of landmass
around the North Pole —
											that was all this grassland.
											And the steppe was magnificent,
											probably one of the most productive
biomes in the world,
											the biggest biome in the world.
											The forest part of it, right now,
Sergey Zimov and Nikita
											go out with this old military tank
they got for nothing,
											and they knock down the trees.
											And that&#39;s a bore, and it&#39;s tiresome,
											and as Sergey says,
&quot;... and they make no dung!&quot;
											which, by the way, these big
animals do, including mammoths.
											So mammoths become
what conservation biologists call
											an umbrella species.
											It&#39;s an exciting animal —
pandas in China or wherever —
											that the excitement that goes on
of making life good for that animal
											is making a habitat, an ecosystem,
											which is good for a whole lot
of creatures and plants,
											and it ideally gets to the point
of being self-managing,
											where the conservation biologists
can back off and say,
											&quot;All we have to do is keep out
the destructive invasives,

civilization-threatening
											climate change coming on very rapidly.
											We have to cease all extra production
of greenhouse gases, especially CO2,
											as soon as possible,

											Plants love CO2.
											What plants are made of is CO2
plus water via sunshine.
											And so in many greenhouses,
industrialized greenhouses,
											they add CO2 because the plants
turn that into plant matter.
											So the studies have been done
with satellites and other things,
											and what you&#39;re seeing here is a graph of,
over the last 33 years or so,
											there&#39;s 14 percent more
leaf action going on.
											There&#39;s that much more biomass.
											There&#39;s that much more
what ecologists call &quot;primary production.&quot;
											There&#39;s that much more life happening,
											thanks to climate change,
											thanks to all of our goddam coal plants.
											So — whoa, what&#39;s going on here?
											By the way, crop production
goes up with this.
											This is a partial counter
											to the increase of CO2,
											because there&#39;s that much more plant
that is sucking it down
											into plant matter.
											Some of that then decays
and goes right back up,
											but some of it is going down into roots
											and going into the soil and staying there.
											So these counter things are part
of what you need to bear in mind,
											and the deeper story is
											that thinking about and dealing with
and engineering climate
											is a pretty complex process.
											It&#39;s like medicine.
											You&#39;re always, again,
tweaking around with the system
											to see what makes an improvement.
											Then you do more of that,
see it&#39;s still getting better,
											then — oop! — that&#39;s enough,

											SB: In this particular study, it turns out
every form of plant is increasing.

left out of this study

in the oceans.
											Primary production in the oceans,
											the biota of the oceans, mostly microbial,
											what they&#39;re up to is probably
the most important thing.
											They&#39;re the ones
that create the atmosphere
											that we&#39;re happily breathing,

James Lovelock has been insisting;

especially of ocean life,
											is fundamentally vapor, in this sense.
											So we&#39;re in the process of finding out
											by inadvertent bad geoengineering
of too much CO2 in the atmosphere,
											finding out, what is
the ocean doing with that?
											Well, the ocean, with the extra heat,
											is swelling up.
											That&#39;s most of where we&#39;re getting
the sea level rise,
											and there&#39;s a lot more coming
with more global warming.
											We&#39;re getting terrible harm
to some of the coral reefs,
											like off of Australia.
											The great reef there is just
a lot of bleaching from overheating.

in our previous session on the main stage,

is worth experimenting with enough

											to see if we can buy time

											SB: The mentor that sort of freed me
											from total allegiance
to Buckminster Fuller
											was Gregory Bateson.
											And Gregory Bateson was an epistemologist
and anthropologist and biologist
											and psychologist and many other things,
											and he looked at how systems
basically look at themselves.
											And that is, I think, part of how
you want to always be looking at things.
											And what I like about David Keith&#39;s
approach to geoengineering
											is you don&#39;t just haul off and do it.
											David Keith&#39;s approach —
											and this is what Danny Hillis
was talking about earlier —
											is that you do it really,
really incrementally,
											you do some stuff to tweak the system,
see how it responds,
											that tells you something about the system.
											That&#39;s responding to the fact
that people say, quite rightly,
											&quot;What are we talking about here?
											We don&#39;t understand
how the climate system works.
											You can&#39;t engineer a system
you don&#39;t understand.&quot;
											And David says, &quot;Well, that certainly
applies to the human body,
											and yet medicine goes ahead,
and we&#39;re kind of glad that it has.&quot;
											The way you engineer a system
that is so large and complex
											that you can&#39;t completely understand it
											is you tweak it,
											and this is kind of
an anti-hubristic approach.
											This is: try a little bit here,
											back the hell off if it&#39;s an issue,
											expand it if it seems to go OK,
											meanwhile, have other paths going forward.
											This is the whole argument for diversity
and dialogue and all these other things

											So the non-hubristic approach
is looking for social license,
											which is a terminology
that I think is a good one,
											of including society enough
											in these interesting,
problematic, deep issues
											that they get to have a pretty good idea
											and have people that they trust
paying close attention
											to the sequence of experiments
as it&#39;s going forward,
											the public dialogue
as it&#39;s going forward —
											which is more public than ever,
which is fantastic —
											and you feel your way,
											you just ooze your way along,
											and this is the muddle-through approach
that has worked pretty well so far.
											The reason that Sebastian
and I are optimistic is we read
											people like Steven Pinker,
&quot;The Better Angels of Our Nature,&quot;
											and so far, so good.
											Now, that can always change,

											CA: Stewart, I think
on that optimistic note,
											we&#39;re actually going to wrap up.
											I am in awe of how you always
are willing to challenge yourself
											and other people.
											I feel like this recipe for never
allowing yourself to be too certain
											is so powerful.
											I want to learn it more for myself,
											and it&#39;s been very insightful
and inspiring, actually,
											listening to you today.
											Stewart Brand, thank you so much.

He spent his early years in India, Pakistan and Afghanistan, where his parents worked as medical missionaries, and he attended an American school in the Himalayas for his early education. After boarding school in Bath, England, he went on to Oxford University, graduating in 1978 with a degree in philosophy, politics and economics.</p><p class=\"p1\">Chris then trained as a journalist, working in newspapers and radio, including two years producing a world news service in the Seychelles Islands.</p><p class=\"p1\"> Back in the UK in 1984, Chris was captivated by the personal computer revolution and became an editor at one of the UK&#39;s early computer magazines. A year later he founded Future Publishing with a $25,000 bank loan. The new company initially focused on specialist computer publications but eventually expanded into other areas such as cycling, music, video games, technology and design, doubling in size every year for seven years. In 1994, Chris moved to the United States where he built Imagine Media, publisher of <em>Business 2.0</em> magazine and creator of the popular video game users website IGN. Chris eventually merged Imagine and Future, taking the combined entity public in London in 1999, under the Future name. At its peak, it published 150 magazines and websites and employed 2,000 people.</p><p class=\"p1\">This success allowed Chris to create a private nonprofit organization, the Sapling Foundation, with the hope of finding new ways to tackle tough global issues through media, technology, entrepreneurship and, most of all, ideas. In 2001, the foundation acquired the TED Conference, then an annual meeting of luminaries in the fields of Technology, Entertainment and Design held in Monterey, California, and Chris left Future to work full time on TED.</p><p class=\"p1\">He expanded the conference&#39;s remit to cover all topics, including science, business and key global issues, while adding a Fellows program, which now has some 300 alumni, and the TED Prize, which grants its recipients &quot;one wish to change the world.&quot; The TED stage has become a place for thinkers and doers from all fields to share their ideas and their work, capturing imaginations, sparking conversation and encouraging discovery along the way.</p><p class=\"p1\">In 2006, TED experimented with posting some of its talks on the Internet. Their viral success encouraged Chris to begin positioning the organization as a global media initiative devoted to &#39;ideas worth spreading,&#39; part of a new era of information dissemination using the power of online video. In June 2015, the organization posted its 2,000th talk online. The talks are free to view, and they have been translated into more than 100 languages with the help of volunteers from around the world. Viewership has grown to approximately one billion views per year.</p><p class=\"p1\">Continuing a strategy of &#39;radical openness,&#39; in 2009 Chris introduced the TEDx initiative, allowing free licenses to local organizers who wished to organize their own TED-like events. More than 8,000 such events have been held, generating an archive of 60,000 TEDx talks. And three years later, the TED-Ed program was launched, offering free educational videos and tools to students and teachers.</p>"}],"url":"https://www.ted.com/talks/stewart_brand_and_chris_anderson_mammoths_resurrected_geoengineering_and_other_thoughts_from_a_futurist","viewed_count":1152921,"talks":[{"explore_cta_experiment":{},"curator_approved":true,"description":"Stewart Brand is a futurist, counterculturist and visionary with a very wide-ranging mind.
