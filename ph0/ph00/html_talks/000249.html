											My thing with school lunch is, it&#39;s a social justice issue.
											I&#39;m the Director of Nutrition Services
											for the Berkeley Unified School District. I have 90 employees
											and 17 locations, 9,600 kids.
											I&#39;m doing 7,100 meals a day
											and I&#39;ve been doing it for two years,
											trying to change how we feed kids in America.
											And that&#39;s what I want to talk to you a little bit about today.
											These are some of my kids with a salad bar.
											I put salad bars in all of our schools when I got there.
											Everyone says it couldn&#39;t be done.
											Little kids couldn&#39;t eat off the salad bar,
											big kids would spit in it — neither happened.

											When I took over this, I tried to really figure out,
											like, what my vision would be.
											How do we really change children&#39;s relationship to food?
											And I&#39;ll tell you why we need to change it,
											but we absolutely have to change it.
											And what I came to understand is,
											we needed to teach children
											the symbiotic relationship
											between a healthy planet, healthy food and healthy kids.
											And that if we don&#39;t do that, the antithesis,
											although we&#39;ve heard otherwise,
											is we&#39;re really going to become extinct,
											because we&#39;re feeding our children to death.
											That&#39;s my premise.

									<p>
											We&#39;re seeing sick kids get sicker and sicker.
											And the reason this is happening, by and large,
											is because of our food system
											and the way the government commodifies food,
											the way the government oversees our food,
											the way the USDA puts food on kids&#39; plates
											that&#39;s unhealthy, and allows unhealthy food into schools.
											And by — tacitly, all of us send our kids,
											or grandchildren, or nieces, or nephews, to school
											and tell them to learn, you know,
											learn what&#39;s in those schools.
											And when you feed these kids bad food,
											that&#39;s what they&#39;re learning. So that&#39;s really what this is all about.

											The way we got here is because of big agribusiness.
											We now live in a country where most of us don&#39;t decide,
											by and large, what we eat. We see big businesses, Monsanto and DuPont,
											who brought out Agent Orange and stain-resistant carpet.
											They control 90 percent of the commercially produced seeds in our country.
											These are — 10 companies
											control much of what&#39;s in our grocery stores,
											much of what people eat. And that&#39;s really, really a problem.

									<p>
											So when I started thinking about these issues
											and how I was going to change what kids ate,
											I really started focusing on what we would teach them.
											And the very first thing
											was about regional food — trying to eat food
											from within our region.
											And clearly, with what&#39;s going on with fossil fuel usage,
											or when — as the fossil fuel is going away,
											as oil hits its peak oil,
											you know, we really have to start thinking about whether or not
											we should, or could, be moving food
											1,500 miles before we eat it.
											So we talked to kids about that,
											and we really start to feed kids regional food.

											And then we talk about organic food.
											Now, most school districts can&#39;t really afford organic food,
											but we, as a nation,
											have to start thinking about
											consuming, growing and feeding our children
											food that&#39;s not chock-full of chemicals.
											We can&#39;t keep feeding our kids pesticides
											and herbicides and antibiotics and hormones.
											We can&#39;t keep doing that.
											You know, it doesn&#39;t work.
											And the results of that are kids getting sick.

											One of my big soapboxes right now is antibiotics.
											Seventy percent of all antibiotics consumed in America
											is consumed in animal husbandry.
											We are feeding our kids antibiotics
											in beef and other animal protein every day.
											Seventy percent — it&#39;s unbelievable.
											And the result of it is, we have diseases.
											We have things like E. coli that we can&#39;t fix,
											that we can&#39;t make kids better when they get sick.
											And, you know, certainly antibiotics have been over-prescribed,
											but it&#39;s an issue in the food supply.
											One of my favorite facts is that
											U.S. agriculture uses 1.2 billion pounds of pesticides every year.
											That means every one of us, and our children,
											consumes what would equal a five-pound bag —
											those bags you have at home. If I had one here
											and ripped it open,
											and that pile I would have on the floor
											is what we consume and feed our children every year
											because of what goes into our food supply,
											because of the way we consume
											produce in America.

											The USDA allows these antibiotics,
											these hormones and these pesticides in our food supply,
											and the USDA paid for this ad
											in Time magazine.
											Okay, we could talk about Rachel Carson and DDT,
											but we know it wasn&#39;t good for you and me.
											And that is what the USDA allows in our food supply.
											And that has to change, you know.
											The USDA cannot be seen as
											the be-all and end-all of what we feed
											our kids and what&#39;s allowed.
											We cannot believe that they have our best interests at heart.
											The antithesis of this whole thing is sustainable food.
											That&#39;s what I really try and get people to understand.
											I really try and teach it to kids. I think it&#39;s the most important.
											It&#39;s consuming food in a way
											in which we&#39;ll still have a planet,
											in which kids will grow up to be healthy,
											and which really tries to mitigate
											all the negative impacts we&#39;re seeing.
											It really is just a new idea.

											In less than 200 years, you know, just in a few generations,

											What&#39;s going to happen to our whole medical system?
											What&#39;s going to happen is,

											And it&#39;s because of what we feed them.
											Because eight-year-olds don&#39;t get to decide —

											You know, we are responsible

											But oops, maybe they&#39;re responsible for what kids eat.
											Big companies spend 20 billion dollars a year

											20 billion dollars a year. 10,000 ads most kids see.
											They spend 500 dollars
											for every one dollar — 500 dollars marketing foods

											And why can they serve that much?
											Why can we have 29-cent Big Gulps

											It&#39;s because of the way the government commodifies food,

											In our school district, the way we afford this
											is our school district allocates .03 percent

											as lunch.

											Okay, Finance 101 on this,
											and this — I&#39;m sort of wrapping it up with this finance piece,
											because I think this is something we all have to understand.
											The National School Lunch Program spends 8 billion dollars
											feeding 30 million children a year.
											That number probably needs to double.
											People say, &quot;Oh my God, where are we going to get 8 billion?&quot;
											In this country, we&#39;re spending 110 billion dollars a year
											on fast food.
											We spend 100 billion dollars a year
											on diet aids.
											We spend 50 billion dollars on vegetables,
											which is why we need all the diet aids.
											We spend 200 billion dollars a year
											on diet-related illness today,
											with nine percent of our kids having type 2 diabetes.
											200 billion.

									<p>
											So you know what, when we talk
											about needing 8 billion more, it&#39;s not a lot.
											That 8 billion comes down to two dollars and 49 cents —
											that&#39;s what the government allocates for lunch.
											Most school districts spend two thirds of that on payroll and overhead.
											That means we spend less than a dollar a day
											on food for kids in schools —
											most schools, 80 to 90 cents. In L.A., it&#39;s 56 cents.
											So we&#39;re spending less than a dollar, OK, on lunch.
											Now I don&#39;t know about you,
											but I go to Starbucks and Pete&#39;s and places like that,
											and venti latte in San Francisco is five dollars.
											One gourmet coffee,
											one, is more —
											we spend more on than we are spending to feed kids
											for an entire week
											in our schools.

									<p>
											You know what? We should be ashamed.
											We, as a country, should be ashamed
											at that.
											The richest country.
											In our country,
											it&#39;s the kids that need it the most,
											who get this really, really lousy food.
											It&#39;s the kids who have parents and grandparents
											and uncles and aunts that can&#39;t even afford
											to pay for school lunch that gets this food.
											And those are the same kids
											who are going to be getting sick.
											Those are the same kids who we should be taking care of.

									<p>
											We can all make a difference.
											That every single one of us,
											whether we have children,
											whether we care about children, whether we have nieces or nephews,
											or anything —
											that we can make a difference.
											Whether you sit down and eat a meal with your kids,
											whether you take your kids, or grandchildren,
											or nieces and nephews shopping
											to a farmers&#39; market. Just do tastings with them.
											Sit down and care.
											And on the macro level,
											we&#39;re in what seems to be
											a 19-month presidential campaign,
											and of all the things we&#39;re asking
											all of these potential leaders,
											what about asking for the health of our children?
											Thank you.
