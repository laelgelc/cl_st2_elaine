											My journey to become a polar specialist,
											photographing, specializing
in the polar regions,
											began when I was four years old,
											when my family moved from southern Canada
											to Northern Baffin Island,
up by Greenland.
											There we lived with the Inuit
											in the tiny Inuit community
of 200 Inuit people,
											where [we] were one
of three non-Inuit families.
											And in this community,
we didn&#39;t have a television;
											we didn&#39;t have computers,
obviously, radio.
											We didn&#39;t even have a telephone.
											All of my time was spent outside
											with the Inuit, playing.
											The snow and the ice were my sandbox,
											and the Inuit were my teachers.
											And that&#39;s where I became
											truly obsessed with this polar realm.
											And I knew someday that
I was going to do something
											that had to do with trying
to share news about it
											and protect it.

											I sat there on the river

											and he went down and grabbed a fish
and went off in the forest and ate it.
											And then I spent the entire day
living my childhood dream
											of walking around with this bear
through the forest.
											He went through this old-growth forest
											and sat up beside this 400-year-old
culturally modified tree and went to sleep.
											And I actually got to sleep
within three feet of him,
											just in the forest, and photograph him.

											We&#39;re inundated with news all the time
											that the sea ice is disappearing
											and it&#39;s at its lowest level.
											And in fact, scientists
were originally saying
											sea ice is going to disappear
in the next hundred years, then they said 50 years.
											Now they&#39;re saying
the sea ice in the Arctic,
											the summertime extent is going to be gone
in the next four to 10 years.
											And what does that mean?
											After a while of reading this in the news,
it just becomes news.
											You glaze over with it.
											And what I&#39;m trying to do
with my work is put faces to this.
											And I want people to understand
and get the concept
											that, if we lose ice,
											we stand to lose an entire ecosystem.
											Projections are that we could
lose polar bears, they could become extinct
											in the next 50 to 100 years.

											And there&#39;s no better, sexier,
											more beautiful,
charismatic megafauna species
											for me to hang my campaign on.
											Polar bears are amazing hunters.
											This was a bear I sat with
for a while on the shores.
											There was no ice around.
											But this glacier caved into the water
and a seal got on it.
											And this bear swam out to that seal —
											800 lb. bearded seal —
											grabbed it, swam back and ate it.
											And he was so full,
he was so happy and so fat eating this seal,
											that, as I approached him —
											about 20 feet away —
to get this picture,
											his only defense was to keep eating more seal.
											And as he ate, he was so full —
											he probably had about
200 lbs of meat in his belly —
											and as he ate inside
one side of his mouth,
											he was regurgitating
out the other side of his mouth.

											So as long as these bears
have any bit of ice they will survive,
											but it&#39;s the ice that&#39;s disappearing.
											We&#39;re finding more and more
dead bears in the Arctic.
											When I worked on polar bears
as a biologist 20 years ago,
											we never found dead bears.
											And in the last four or five years,
											we&#39;re finding dead bears
popping up all over the place.
											We&#39;re seeing them in the Beaufort Sea,
											floating in the open ocean
where the ice has melted out.
											I found a couple in Norway last year.
We&#39;re seeing them on the ice.
											These bears are already showing signs
											of the stress of disappearing ice.

											These ringed seals,
these are the &quot;fatsicles&quot; of the Arctic.
											These little, fat dumplings,
											150-pound bundles of blubber
											are the mainstay of the polar bear.
											And they&#39;re not like
the harbor seals that you have here.
											These ringed seals also
live out their entire life cycle
											associated and connected to sea ice.
											They give birth inside the ice,
											and they feed on the Arctic cod
that live under the ice.
											And here&#39;s a picture of sick ice.
											This is a piece of multi-year ice
that&#39;s 12 years old.
											And what scientists didn&#39;t predict
is that, as this ice melts,
											these big pockets
of black water are forming
											and they&#39;re grabbing the sun&#39;s energy
											and accelerating the melting process.

											I wish I could spend half
an hour telling you
											about how we almost died on this dive.
											But what&#39;s important in this picture
is that you have a piece of multi-year ice,
											that big chunk of ice up in the corner.
											In that one single piece of ice,
											you have 300 species of microorganisms.
											And in the spring,
when the sun returns to the ice,
											it forms the phytoplankton,
grows under that ice,
											and then you get bigger sheets of seaweed,
											and then you get the
zooplankton feeding on all that life.
											So really what the ice does

											It acts like the soil in a garden.

											Alright, my favorite part.
											When I&#39;m on my deathbed,

one story more than any other.
											Even though that spirit bear
moment was powerful,
											I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever have
another experience

											Leopard seals, since the time of Shackleton,
have had a bad reputation.
											They&#39;ve got that wryly smile
on their mouth.
											They&#39;ve got those black sinister eyes
											and those spots on their body.
											They look positively prehistoric
and a bit scary.
											And tragically in [2003],
											a scientist was taken down
and drowned,
											and she was being consumed
by a leopard seal.
											And people were like, &quot;We knew
they were vicious. We knew they were.&quot;
											And so people love to form their opinions.
											And that&#39;s when I got a story idea:
											I want to go to Antarctica,
											get in the water with as many
leopard seals as I possibly can
											and give them a fair shake —
											find out if they really are these vicious
animals, or if they&#39;re misunderstood.
											So this is that story.
											Oh, and they also happen
to eat Happy Feet.

											As a species, as humans,
we like to say penguins are really cute,

so leopard seals are ugly and bad.
											It doesn&#39;t work that way.
											The penguin doesn&#39;t know it&#39;s cute,
											and the leopard seal doesn&#39;t
know it&#39;s kind of big and monstrous.
											This is just the food chain unfolding.
											They&#39;re also big.
											They&#39;re not these little harbor seals.
											They are 12 ft. long, a thousand pounds.
											And they&#39;re also curiously aggressive.
											You get 12 tourists packed into a Zodiac,

											and there&#39;s this monstrous leopard seal.
											And even in his voice, he goes,
&quot;That&#39;s a bloody big seal, ya.&quot;
											(Laughter)
											And this seal is taking
this penguin by the head,
											and it&#39;s flipping it back and forth.
											And what it&#39;s trying to do
is turn that penguin inside-out,
											so it can eat the meat off the bones,
											and then it goes off and gets another one.

											And so this leopard seal
grabbed another penguin,
											came under the boat, the Zodiac,
											starting hitting the hull of the boat.
											And we&#39;re trying to not fall in the water.
											And we sit down,
and that&#39;s when Goran said to me,
											&quot;This is a good seal, ya.
											It&#39;s time for you to get in the water.&quot;
											(Laughter)
											And I looked at Goran,
and I said to him, &quot;Forget that.&quot;
											But I think I probably used a different word
starting with the letter &quot;F.&quot;
											But he was right.
											He scolded me out,
and said, &quot;This is why we&#39;re here.
											And you purposed this stupid story
to National Geographic.
											And now you&#39;ve got to deliver.
											And you can&#39;t publish excuses.&quot;

											So I had such dry mouth —
											probably not as bad as now —
											but I had such, such dry mouth.
											And my legs were just trembling.
I couldn&#39;t feel my legs.
											I put my flippers on.
I could barely part my lips.
											I put my snorkel in my mouth,
											and I rolled over the side
of the Zodiac into the water.
											And this was the first thing she did.
											She came racing up to me,
engulfed my whole camera —
											and her teeth are up here
and down here —
											but Goran, before I had gotten in the water,
had given me amazing advice.
											He said, &quot;If you get scared,
you close your eyes, ya, and she&#39;ll go away.&quot;

											So that&#39;s all I had to work
with at that point.
											But I just started to shoot these pictures.
											So she did this threat display
for a few minutes,
											and then the most amazing thing happened —
she totally relaxed.
											She went off, she got a penguin.
											She stopped about 10 feet away from me,
											and she sat there with this penguin,
the penguin&#39;s flapping, and she let&#39;s it go.
											The penguin swims toward me, takes off.
											She grabs another one.
She does this over and over.
											And it dawned on me
that she&#39;s trying to feed me a penguin.
											Why else would she release
these penguins at me?
											And after she did this four or five times,
											she swam by me
with this dejected look on her face.
											You don&#39;t want to be too anthropomorphic,
but I swear that she looked at me
											like, &quot;This useless predator&#39;s
going to starve in my ocean.&quot;

									<p>
											So realizing I couldn&#39;t catch
swimming penguins,
											she&#39;d get these other penguins
and bring them slowly towards me,
											bobbing like this,
and she&#39;d let them go.
											This didn&#39;t work.
											I was laughing so hard and so emotional
											that my mask was flooding,
because I was crying underwater,
											just because it was so amazing.
											And so that didn&#39;t work.
											So then she&#39;d get another penguin
and try this ballet-like sexy display
											sliding down this iceberg like this. (Laughter)
											And she would sort of bring them
over to me and offer it to me.
											This went on for four days.
											This just didn&#39;t happen a couple of times.
											And then so she realized
I couldn&#39;t catch live ones,
											so she brought me dead penguins.
											(Laughter)
											Now I&#39;ve got four or five penguins
floating around my head,
											and I&#39;m just sitting there shooting away.
											And she would often stop
and have this dejected look on her face
											like, &quot;Are you for real?&quot;
											Because she can&#39;t believe
I can&#39;t eat this penguin.
											Because in her world,
you&#39;re either breeding or you&#39;re eating —
											and I&#39;m not breeding, so ...

											And then that wasn&#39;t enough;
she started to flip penguins onto my head.
											She was trying to force-feed me.
She&#39;s pushing me around.
											She&#39;s trying to force-feed my camera,
											which is every photographer&#39;s dream.
											And she would get frustrated;
she&#39;d blow bubbles in my face.

											And on the last day with this female
											where I thought I had pushed her too far,
											I got nervous because she came up to me,
											she rolled over on her back,
											and she did this deep, guttural
jackhammer sound, this gok-gok-gok-gok.
											And I thought, she&#39;s about to bite.
											She&#39;s about to let me know
she&#39;s too frustrated with me.
											What had happened
was another seal had snuck in behind me,

											She chased that big seal away,
went and got its penguin

Best known for his vivid and intimate wildlife photos for <em>National Geographic</em>, Nicklen started out a biologist in the Northwest Territories, gathering data on such species as lynx, grizzlies, and polar bears. Today he bridges the gap between scientific research and the public, showing how fragile and fast-changing habitats are profoundly affecting wildlife.<br /><br />During the course of his workday Nicklen regularly comes face-to-face with fantastic creatures: narwhals, Arctic foxes, elephant seals, and more. His most amazing experience? An underwater encounter with a leopard seal who for four days tried to feed him penguins through the &quot;mouth&quot; of his lens.</p>"}],"speaker_name":"Paul Nicklen","tags":["animals","biodiversity","creativity","culture","design","entertainment","photography","storytelling","Antarctica"],"title":"Animal tales from icy wonderlands","video_type":{"id":"1","name":"TED Stage Talk"},"viewed_count":2385322}]}})</script></div>
