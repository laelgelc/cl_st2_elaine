											I&#39;m supposed to scare you, because it&#39;s about fear, right?
											And you should be really afraid,
											but not for the reasons why you think you should be.
											You should be really afraid that —
											if we stick up the first slide on this thing — there we go — that you&#39;re missing out.
											Because if you spend this week thinking about Iraq and
											thinking about Bush and thinking about the stock market,
											you&#39;re going to miss one of the greatest adventures that we&#39;ve ever been on.
											And this is what this adventure&#39;s really about.
											This is crystallized DNA.
											Every life form on this planet — every insect, every bacteria, every plant,
											every animal, every human, every politician — (Laughter)
											is coded in that stuff.
											And if you want to take a single crystal of DNA, it looks like that.
											And we&#39;re just beginning to understand this stuff.
											And this is the single most exciting adventure that we have ever been on.
											It&#39;s the single greatest mapping project we&#39;ve ever been on.
											If you think that the mapping of America&#39;s made a difference,
											or landing on the moon, or this other stuff,
											it&#39;s the map of ourselves and the map of every plant

											It turns out that what this stuff is —
											and Richard Dawkins has written about this —
											is, this is really a river out of Eden.
											So, the 3.2 billion base pairs inside each of your cells
											is really a history of where you&#39;ve been for the past billion years.
											And we could start dating things,
											and we could start changing medicine and archeology.
											It turns out that if you take the human species about 700 years ago,
											white Europeans diverged from black Africans in a very significant way.
											White Europeans were subject to the plague.
											And when they were subject to the plague, most people didn&#39;t survive,
											but those who survived had a mutation on the CCR5 receptor.
											And that mutation was passed on to their kids
											because they&#39;re the ones that survived,
											so there was a great deal of population pressure.
											In Africa, because you didn&#39;t have these cities,
											you didn&#39;t have that CCR5 population pressure mutation.
											We can date it to 700 years ago.
											That is one of the reasons why AIDS is raging across Africa as fast as it is,
											and not as fast across Europe.
											And we&#39;re beginning to find these little things for malaria,
											for sickle cell, for cancers.
											And in the measure that we map ourselves,
											this is the single greatest adventure that we&#39;ll ever be on.
											And this Friday, I want you to pull out a really good bottle of wine,
											and I want you to toast these two people.
											Because this Friday, 50 years ago, Watson and Crick found the structure of DNA,
											and that is almost as important a date
											as the 12th of February when we first mapped ourselves,
											but anyway, we&#39;ll get to that.

											So, all you guys have heard about DNA, all the stuff that DNA does,
											but some of the stuff we&#39;re discovering is kind of nifty
											because this turns out to be the single most abundant species on the planet.
											If you think you&#39;re successful or cockroaches are successful,
											it turns out that there&#39;s ten trillion trillion Pleurococcus sitting out there.
											And we didn&#39;t know that Pleurococcus was out there,
											which is part of the reason
											why this whole species-mapping project is so important.
											Because we&#39;re just beginning to learn
											where we came from and what we are.
											And we&#39;re finding amoebas like this. This is the amoeba dubia.
											And the amoeba dubia doesn&#39;t look like much,
											except that each of you has about 3.2 billion letters,
											which is what makes you you,
											as far as gene code inside each of your cells,
											and this little amoeba which, you know,
											sits in water in hundreds and millions and billions,
											turns out to have 620 billion base pairs of gene code inside.
											So, this little thingamajig has a genome
											that&#39;s 200 times the size of yours.
											And if you&#39;re thinking of efficient information storage mechanisms,
											it may not turn out to be chips.
											It may turn out to be something that looks a little like that amoeba.

											This funky little thing: people didn&#39;t used to think
											that it was worth taking samples out of nuclear reactors
											because it was dangerous and, of course, nothing lived there.
											And then finally somebody picked up a microscope
											and looked at the water that was sitting next to the cores.
											And sitting next to that water in the cores
											was this little Deinococcus radiodurans, doing a backstroke,

											Now, the last of these things died in September 1936.

											But it turns out that as we learn more about gene code
											and how to reprogram species,
											we may be able to close the gene gaps in deteriorate DNA.
											And when we learn how to close the gene gaps,
											then we can put a full string of DNA together.
											And if we do that, and insert this into a fertilized wolf&#39;s egg,
											we may give birth to an animal
											that hasn&#39;t walked the earth since 1936.
											And then you can start going back further,

											The reason why he&#39;s reprogramming that animal to have more wings

											Not so in human beings:
											you cut off an arm, you cut off a leg — it doesn&#39;t regrow.

											Here&#39;s what&#39;s happening in the world.
											It turns out that if you&#39;d gone to the U.N. in 1950,
											when it was founded, there were 50 countries in this world.
											It turns out there&#39;s now about 192.
											Country after country is splitting, seceding, succeeding, failing —
											and it&#39;s all getting very fragmented. And this has not stopped.
											In the 1990s, these are sovereign states
											that did not exist before 1990.
											And this doesn&#39;t include fusions or name changes or changes in flags.
											We&#39;re generating about 3.12 states per year.
											People are taking control of their own states,
											sometimes for the better and sometimes for the worse.
											And the really interesting thing is,
											you and your kids are empowered to build great empires,
											and you don&#39;t need a lot to do it.
											(Music)
											And, given that the music is over, I was going to talk
											about how you can use this to generate a lot of wealth,
											and how code works.
											Moderator: Two minutes.
											(Laughter)
											Juan Enriquez: No, I&#39;m going to stop there and we&#39;ll do it next year
											because I don&#39;t want to take any of Laurie&#39;s time.
											But thank you very much.
