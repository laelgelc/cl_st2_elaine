											My mother wanted me to be a dentist.
											But the problem was that people kept blowing everything up.
											So I actually went to school in Belfast,
											which was where all the action happened.
											And this was a pretty common sight.
											The school I went to was pretty boring.
											They forced us to learn things like Latin.
											The school teachers weren&#39;t having much fun,
											the sports were very dirty or very painful.
											So I cleverly chose rowing, which I got very good at.

											So this was extremely embarrassing.
											But our school at that time got a grant from the government,
											and they got an incredible computer — the research machine 3DZ —
											and they left the programming manuals lying around.
											And so students like myself with nothing to do,
											we would learn how to program it.
											Also around this time, at home,
											this was the computer that people were buying.
											It was called the Sinclair ZX80. This was a 1K computer,

											And — you see the picture at the bottom?
											There&#39;s a picture of a guy doing homework with his son.
											That&#39;s what they thought they had built it for.
											The reality is we got the programming manual
											and we started making games for it.
											We were programming in BASIC,
											which is a pretty awful language for games,
											so we ended up learning Assembly language
											so we could really take control of the hardware.
											This is the guy that invented it, Sir Clive Sinclair,

											Some of the highlights were things like &quot;The Terminator,&quot;
											&quot;Aladdin,&quot; the &quot;Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles.&quot;
											Because I was from the United Kingdom,
											they thought the word ninja was a little too mean for children,

											Now, Chris did ask me to bring some statistics with me,
											so I&#39;ve done that.
											The video game industry in 2005 became a 29 billion dollar business.
											It grows every year.
											Last year was the biggest year.
											By 2008, we&#39;re going to kick the butt of the music industry.
											By 2010, we&#39;re going to hit 42 billion.
											43 percent of gamers are female.
											So there&#39;s a lot more female gamers than people are really aware.

											The average age of gamers?
											Well, obviously it&#39;s for children, right?
											Well, no, actually it&#39;s 30 years old.
											And interestingly, the people who buy the most games are 37.
											So 37 is our target audience.
											All video games are violent.
											Of course the newspapers love to beat on this.
											But 83 percent of games don&#39;t have any mature content whatsoever,
											so it&#39;s just not true.

											Online gaming statistics.
											I brought some stuff on &quot;World of Warcraft.&quot; It&#39;s 5.5 million players.
											It makes about 80 million bucks a month in subscriptions.
											It costs 50 bucks just to install it on your computer,
											making the publisher about another 275 million.
											The game costs about 80 million dollars to make,
											so basically it pays for itself in about a month.
											A player in a game called &quot;Project Entropia&quot;
											actually bought his own island for 26,500 dollars.
											You have to remember that this is not a real island.
											He didn&#39;t actually buy anything, just some data.

											This market is now estimated at over 800 million dollars annually.
											And what&#39;s interesting about it is the market was actually created
											by the gamers themselves.
											They found clever ways to trade items
											and to sell their accounts to each other
											so that they could make money while they were playing their games.
											I dove onto eBay a couple of days ago
											just to see what was gong on, typed in World of Warcraft, got 6,000 items.

											David Perry: The thing again I want you to think about is,

											Think about that&#39;s where we are right now,
											and the curve that we&#39;re on means that this is going to continue
											to get better.
											This is an example of the kind of graphics you need to be able to draw
											if you wanted to get a job in the video game industry today.
											You need to be really an incredible artist.
											And once we get enough of those guys, we&#39;re going to want

											I am just one of a new generation that is growing up.
											A generation who may experience much more meaning
											through video games than they will through the real world.
											Video games are nearing an evolutionary leap,
											a point where game worlds will look and feel just as real
											as the films we see in theatres, or the news we watch on TV.
											And while my sense of free will in these virtual worlds
											may still be limited, what I do learn applies to my real life.
											Play enough video games and eventually you will
											really believe you can snowboard, fly a plane,
											drive a nine-second quarter mile, or kill a man.
											I know I can.

											Unlike any pop culture phenomenon before it,
											video games actually allow us to become part of the machine.
											They allow us to sublimate into the culture of interactive,
											downloaded, streaming, HD reality.
											We are interacting with our entertainment.
											I have come to expect this level of interaction.
											Without it, the problems faced in the real world —
											poverty, war, disease and genocide — lack the levity they should.
											Their importance blends into the sensationalized drama
											of prime time TV.

											But the beauty of video games today lies not in the lifelike graphics,

											The people who create these games are smart.
											They know what makes me scared, excited, panicked, proud or sad.
											Then they use these emotions to dimensionalize the worlds they create.
											A well-designed video game will seamlessly
											weave the user into the fabric of the virtual experience.
											As one becomes more experienced
											the awareness of physical control melts away.
											I know what I want and I do it.
											No buttons to push, no triggers to pull, just me and the game.
											My fate and the fate of the world around me lie inside my hands.
											I know violent video games make my mother worry.
											What troubles me is not that video game violence
											is becoming more and more like real life violence,
											but that real life violence is starting to look more and more
											like a video game.

											Perhaps there is a single part of our brain that holds
											all of our gut instincts, the things we know to do
											before we even think.
											While some of these instincts may be innate, most are learned,
											and all of them are hardwired into our brains.
											These instincts are essential for survival in both real and virtual worlds.
											Only in recent years has the technology behind video games
											allowed for a true overlap in stimuli.
											As gamers we are now living by the same laws of physics
											in the same cities and doing many of the same things
											we once did in real life, only virtually.
											Consider this —
											my real life car has about 25,000 miles on it.
											In all my driving games, I&#39;ve driven a total of 31,459 miles.
											To some degree I&#39;ve learned how to drive from the game.
											The sensory cues are very similar.
											It&#39;s a funny feeling when you have spent more time
											doing something on the TV than you have in real life.
											When I am driving down a road at sunset all I can think is,
											this is almost as beautiful as my games are.

											For my virtual worlds are perfect.
											More beautiful and rich than the real world around us.
											I&#39;m not sure what the implications of my experience are,
											but the potential for using realistic video game stimuli in repetition
											on a vast number of loyal participants is frightening to me.
											Today I believe Big Brother would find much more success
											brainwashing the masses with video games
											rather than just simply TVs.
											Video games are fun, engaging, and leave your brain
											completely vulnerable to re-programming.
											But maybe brainwashing isn&#39;t always bad.

											Imagine a game that teaches us to respect each other,

											There is a potential to do good as well.
											It is critical, as these virtual worlds continue to mirror

											What I have only recently come to realize
