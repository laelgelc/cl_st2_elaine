											I didn&#39;t always love unintended consequences,
											but I&#39;ve really learned to appreciate them.
											I&#39;ve learned that they&#39;re really the essence
											of what makes for progress,
											even when they seem to be terrible.
											And I&#39;d like to review
											just how unintended consequences
											play the part that they do.

											Let&#39;s go to 40,000 years before the present,
											to the time of the cultural explosion,
											when music, art, technology,
											so many of the things that we&#39;re enjoying today,
											so many of the things that are being demonstrated at TED
											were born.
											And the anthropologist Randall White
											has made a very interesting observation:
											that if our ancestors
											40,000 years ago
											had been able to see
											what they had done,
											they wouldn&#39;t have really understood it.
											They were responding
											to immediate concerns.
											They were making it possible for us
											to do what they do,
											and yet, they didn&#39;t really understand
											how they did it.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now let&#39;s advance to 10,000 years before the present.
											And this is when it really gets interesting.
											What about the domestication of grains?
											What about the origins of agriculture?
											What would our ancestors 10,000 years ago
											have said
											if they really had technology assessment?
											And I could just imagine the committees
											reporting back to them
											on where agriculture was going to take humanity,
											at least in the next few hundred years.
											It was really bad news.
											First of all, worse nutrition,
											maybe shorter life spans.
											It was simply awful for women.
											The skeletal remains from that period
											have shown that they were grinding grain morning, noon and night.
											And politically, it was awful.
											It was the beginning of a much higher degree
											of inequality among people.
											If there had been rational technology assessment then,
											I think they very well might have said,
											&quot;Let&#39;s call the whole thing off.&quot;

									<p>
											Even now, our choices are having unintended effects.
											Historically, for example,
											chopsticks — according to one Japanese anthropologist
											who wrote a dissertation about it
											at the University of Michigan —
											resulted in long-term changes
											in the dentition, in the teeth,
											of the Japanese public.
											And we are also changing our teeth right now.
											There is evidence
											that the human mouth and teeth
											are growing smaller all the time.
											That&#39;s not necessarily a bad unintended consequence.
											But I think from the point of view of a Neanderthal,
											there would have been a lot of disapproval
											of the wimpish choppers that we now have.
											So these things are kind of relative
											to where you or your ancestors happen to stand.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											In the ancient world
											there was a lot of respect for unintended consequences,
											and there was a very healthy sense of caution,
											reflected in the Tree of Knowledge,
											in Pandora&#39;s Box,
											and especially in the myth of Prometheus
											that&#39;s been so important
											in recent metaphors about technology.
											And that&#39;s all very true.
											The physicians of the ancient world —
											especially the Egyptians,
											who started medicine as we know it —
											were very conscious
											of what they could and couldn&#39;t treat.
											And the translations of the surviving texts say,
											&quot;This I will not treat. This I cannot treat.&quot;
											They were very conscious.
											So were the followers of Hippocrates.
											The Hippocratic manuscripts also —
											repeatedly, according to recent studies —
											show how important it is not to do harm.
											More recently,
											Harvey Cushing,
											who really developed neurosurgery as we know it,
											who changed it from a field of medicine
											that had a majority of deaths resulting from surgery
											to one in which there was a hopeful outlook,
											he was very conscious
											that he was not always going to do the right thing.
											But he did his best,
											and he kept meticulous records
											that let him transform that branch of medicine.

											Now if we look forward a bit
											to the 19th century,
											we find a new style of technology.
											What we find is,
											no longer simple tools,
											but systems.
											We find more and more
											complex arrangements of machines
											that make it harder and harder
											to diagnose what&#39;s going on.
											And the first people who saw that
											were the telegraphers of the mid-19th century,
											who were the original hackers.
											Thomas Edison would have been very, very comfortable
											in the atmosphere of a software firm today.
											And these hackers had a word
											for those mysterious bugs in telegraph systems
											that they called bugs.
											That was the origin of the word &quot;bug.&quot;
											This consciousness, though,
											was a little slow to seep through the general population,
											even people who were very, very well informed.

											Samuel Clemens, Mark Twain,
											was a big investor
											in the most complex machine of all times —
											at least until 1918 —
											registered with the U.S. Patent Office.
											That was the Paige typesetter.
											The Paige typesetter
											had 18,000 parts.
											The patent had 64 pages of text
											and 271 figures.
											It was such a beautiful machine
											because it did everything that a human being did
											in setting type —
											including returning the type to its place,
											which was a very difficult thing.
											And Mark Twain, who knew all about typesetting,
											really was smitten by this machine.
											Unfortunately, he was smitten in more ways than one,
											because it made him bankrupt,
											and he had to tour the world speaking
											to recoup his money.
											And this was an important thing
											about 19th century technology,
											that all these relationships among parts
											could make the most brilliant idea fall apart,
											even when judged by the most expert people.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now there is something else, though, in the early 20th century
											that made things even more complicated.
											And that was that safety technology itself
											could be a source of danger.
											The lesson of the Titanic, for a lot of the contemporaries,
											was that you must have enough lifeboats
											for everyone on the ship.
											And this was the result
											of the tragic loss of lives
											of people who could not get into them.
											However, there was another case, the Eastland,
											a ship that capsized in Chicago Harbor in 1915,
											and it killed 841 people —
											that was 14 more
											than the passenger toll of the Titanic.
											The reason for it, in part, was
											the extra life boats that were added
											that made this already unstable ship
											even more unstable.
											And that again proves
											that when you&#39;re talking about unintended consequences,
											it&#39;s not that easy to know
											the right lessons to draw.
											It&#39;s really a question of the system, how the ship was loaded,
											the ballast and many other things.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So the 20th century, then,
											saw how much more complex reality was,
											but it also saw a positive side.
											It saw that invention
											could actually benefit from emergencies.
											It could benefit
											from tragedies.
											And my favorite example of that —
											which is not really widely known
											as a technological miracle,
											but it may be one of the greatest of all times,
											was the scaling up of penicillin in the Second World War.
											Penicillin was discovered in 1928,
											but even by 1940,
											no commercially and medically useful quantities of it
											were being produced.
											A number of pharmaceutical companies were working on it.
											They were working on it independently,
											and they weren&#39;t getting anywhere.
											And the Government Research Bureau
											brought representatives together
											and told them that this is something
											that has to be done.
											And not only did they do it,
											but within two years,
											they scaled up penicillin
											from preparation in one-liter flasks
											to 10,000-gallon vats.
											That was how quickly penicillin was produced
											and became one of the greatest medical advances of all time.
											In the Second World War, too,
											the existence
											of solar radiation
											was demonstrated by studies of interference
											that was detected by the radar stations of Great Britain.
											So there were benefits in calamities —
											benefits to pure science,
											as well as to applied science
											and medicine.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now when we come to the period after the Second World War,
											unintended consequences get even more interesting.
											And my favorite example of that
											occurred beginning in 1976,
											when it was discovered
											that the bacteria causing Legionnaires disease
											had always been present in natural waters,
											but it was the precise temperature of the water
											in heating, ventilating and air conditioning systems
											that raised the right temperature
											for the maximum reproduction
											of Legionella bacillus.
											Well, technology to the rescue.
											So chemists got to work,
											and they developed a bactericide
											that became widely used in those systems.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											But something else happened in the early 1980s,
											and that was that there was a mysterious epidemic
											of failures of tape drives
											all over the United States.
											And IBM, which made them,
											just didn&#39;t know what to do.
											They commissioned a group of their best scientists
											to investigate,
											and what they found was
											that all these tape drives
											were located near ventilation ducts.
											What happened was the bactericide was formulated
											with minute traces of tin.
											And these tin particles were deposited on the tape heads
											and were crashing the tape heads.
											So they reformulated the bactericide.
											But what&#39;s interesting to me
											is that this was the first case
											of a mechanical device
											suffering, at least indirectly, from a human disease.
											So it shows that we&#39;re really all in this together.

											In fact, it also shows something interesting,
											that although our capabilities and technology
											have been expanding geometrically,
											unfortunately, our ability to model their long-term behavior,
											which has also been increasing,
											has been increasing only arithmetically.
											So one of the characteristic problems of our time
											is how to close this gap
											between capabilities and foresight.
											One other very positive consequence
											of 20th century technology, though,
											was the way in which other kinds of calamities
											could lead to positive advances.
											There are two historians of business
											at the University of Maryland,
											Brent Goldfarb and David Kirsch,
											who have done some extremely interesting work,
											much of it still unpublished,
											on the history of major innovations.
											They have combined the list of major innovations,
											and they&#39;ve discovered that the greatest number, the greatest decade,
											for fundamental innovations,
											as reflected in all of the lists that others have made —
											a number of lists that they have merged —
											was the Great Depression.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And nobody knows just why this was so,
											but one story can reflect something of it.
											It was the origin of the Xerox copier,
											which celebrated its 50th anniversary
											last year.
											And Chester Carlson, the inventor,
											was a patent attorney.
											He really was not intending
											to work in patent research,
											but he couldn&#39;t really find an alternative technical job.
											So this was the best job he could get.
											He was upset by the low quality and high cost
											of existing patent reproductions,
											and so he started to develop
											a system of dry photocopying,
											which he patented in the late 1930s —
											and which became the first dry photocopier
											that was commercially practical
											in 1960.
											So we see that sometimes,
											as a result of these dislocations,
											as a result of people
											leaving their original intended career
											and going into something else
											where their creativity could make a difference,
											that depressions
											and all kinds of other unfortunate events
											can have a paradoxically stimulating effect
											on creativity.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											What does this mean?
											It means, I think,
											that we&#39;re living in a time of unexpected possibilities.
											Think of the financial world, for example.
											The mentor of Warren Buffett, Benjamin Graham,
											developed his system of value investing
											as a result of his own losses
											in the 1929 crash.
											And he published that book
											in the early 1930s,
											and the book still exists in further editions
											and is still a fundamental textbook.
											So many important creative things can happen
											when people learn from disasters.

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now think of the large and small plagues that we have now —
											bed bugs, killer bees, spam —
											and it&#39;s very possible that the solutions to those
											will really extend well beyond the immediate question.
											If we think, for example, of Louis Pasteur,
											who in the 1860s
											was asked to study
											the diseases of silk worms for the silk industry,
											and his discoveries were really the beginning
											of the germ theory of disease.
											So very often, some kind of disaster —
											sometimes the consequence, for example,
											of over-cultivation of silk worms,
											which was a problem in Europe at the time —
											can be the key to something much bigger.

											So this means
											that we need to take a different view
											of unintended consequences.
											We need to take a really positive view.
											We need to see what they can do for us.
											We need to learn
											from those figures that I mentioned.
											We need to learn, for example, from Dr. Cushing,
											who killed patients
											in the course of his early operations.
											He had to have some errors. He had to have some mistakes.
											And he learned meticulously from his mistakes.
											And as a result,
											when we say, &quot;This isn&#39;t brain surgery,&quot;
											that pays tribute to how difficult it was
											for anyone to learn from their mistakes
											in a field of medicine
											that was considered so discouraging in its prospects.
											And we can also remember
											how the pharmaceutical companies
											were willing to pool their knowledge,
											to share their knowledge,
											in the face of an emergency,
											which they hadn&#39;t really been for years and years.
											They might have been able to do it earlier.
