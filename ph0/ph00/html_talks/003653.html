											So there is among many people —
											certainly me and most of the people I talk to —
											a kind of collective dissatisfaction
											with the way things are working,
											with the way our institutions run.
											Our kids&#39; teachers seem to be failing them.
											Our doctors don&#39;t know who the hell we are,
											and they don&#39;t have enough time for us.
											We certainly can&#39;t trust the bankers,
											and we certainly can&#39;t trust the brokers.
											They almost brought the entire financial system down.
											And even as we do our own work,
											all too often,
											we find ourselves having to choose
											between doing what we think is the right thing
											and doing the expected thing,
											or the required thing,
											or the profitable thing.
											So everywhere we look,
											pretty much across the board,
											we worry that the people we depend on
											don&#39;t really have our interests at heart.
											Or if they do have our interests at heart,
											we worry that they don&#39;t know us well enough
											to figure out what they need to do
											in order to allow us
											to secure those interests.
											They don&#39;t understand us.
											They don&#39;t have the time to get to know us.

									<p>
											There are two kinds of responses
											that we make
											to this sort of general dissatisfaction.
											If things aren&#39;t going right,
											the first response is:
											let&#39;s make more rules,
											let&#39;s set up a set
											of detailed procedures
											to make sure that people will do the right thing.
											Give teachers scripts
											to follow in the classroom,
											so even if they don&#39;t know what they&#39;re doing
											and don&#39;t care about the welfare of our kids,
											as long as they follow the scripts,
											our kids will get educated.
											Give judges a list of mandatory sentences
											to impose for crimes,
											so that you don&#39;t need to rely
											on judges using their judgment.
											Instead, all they have to do
											is look up on the list
											what kind of sentence goes with what kind of crime.
											Impose limits
											on what credit card companies can charge in interest
											and on what they can charge in fees.
											More and more rules
											to protect us
											against an indifferent, uncaring
											set of institutions we have to deal with.

								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Or — or maybe and —
											in addition to rules,
											let&#39;s see if we can come up
											with some really clever incentives
											so that, even if the people we deal with
											don&#39;t particularly want to serve our interests,
											it is in their interest
											to serve our interest —
											the magic incentives
											that will get people to do the right thing
											even out of pure selfishness.
											So we offer teachers bonuses
											if the kids they teach
											score passing grades on these big test scores
											that are used to evaluate
											the quality of school systems.

											Rules and incentives —
											&quot;sticks&quot; and &quot;carrots.&quot;
											We passed a bunch of rules
											to regulate the financial industry
											in response to the recent collapse.
											There&#39;s the Dodd-Frank Act,
											there&#39;s the new Consumer Financial Protection Agency
											that is temporarily being headed through the backdoor
											by Elizabeth Warren.
											Maybe these rules
											will actually improve
											the way these financial services companies behave.
											We&#39;ll see.
											In addition, we are struggling
											to find some way to create incentives
											for people in the financial services industry
											that will have them more interested
											in serving the long-term interests
											even of their own companies,
											rather than securing short-term profits.
											So if we find just the right incentives,
											they&#39;ll do the right thing — as I said — selfishly,
											and if we come up with the right rules and regulations,
											they won&#39;t drive us all over a cliff.
											And Ken [Sharpe] and I certainly know
											that you need to reign in the bankers.
											If there is a lesson to be learned from the financial collapse
											it is that.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											But what we believe,
											and what we argue in the book,
											is that there is no set of rules,
											no matter how detailed,
											no matter how specific,
											no matter how carefully monitored
											and enforced,
											there is no set of rules
											that will get us what we need.
											Why? Because bankers are smart people.
											And, like water,
											they will find cracks
											in any set of rules.
											You design a set of rules that will make sure
											that the particular reason
											why the financial system &quot;almost-collapse&quot;
											can&#39;t happen again.
											It is naive beyond description
											to think that having blocked
											this source of financial collapse,
											you have blocked all possible sources of financial collapse.
											So it&#39;s just a question of waiting for the next one
											and then marveling at how we could have been so stupid
											as not to protect ourselves against that.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											What we desperately need,
											beyond, or along with, better rules
											and reasonably smart incentives,
											is we need virtue.
											We need character.
											We need people who want to do the right thing.
											And in particular,
											the virtue that we need most of all
											is the virtue that Aristotle called
											&quot;practical wisdom.&quot;
											Practical wisdom
											is the moral will
											to do the right thing
											and the moral skill
											to figure out what the right thing is.
											So Aristotle was very interested in watching
											how the craftsmen around him worked.
											And he was impressed
											at how they would improvise
											novel solutions to novel problems —
											problems that they hadn&#39;t anticipated.
											So one example is he sees these stonemasons
											working on the Isle of Lesbos,
											and they need to measure out
											round columns.
											Well if you think about it,
											it&#39;s really hard to measure out round columns using a ruler.
											So what do they do?
											They fashion a novel solution to the problem.
											They created a ruler that bends,
											what we would call these days a tape measure —
											a flexible rule,
											a rule that bends.
											And Aristotle said,
											&quot;Hah, they appreciated that sometimes
											to design rounded columns,
											you need to bend the rule.&quot;
											And Aristotle said
											often in dealing with other people,
											we need to bend the rules.
									</p>

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Dealing with other people
											demands a kind of flexibility
											that no set of rules can encompass.
											Wise people know when and how
											to bend the rules.
											Wise people know how to improvise.
											The way my co-author , Ken, and I talk about it,
											they are kind of like jazz musicians.
											The rules are like the notes on the page,
											and that gets you started,
											but then you dance around the notes on the page,
											coming up with just the right combination
											for this particular moment
											with this particular set of fellow players.
											So for Aristotle,
											the kind
											of rule-bending,
											rule exception-finding and improvisation
											that you see in skilled craftsmen
											is exactly what you need
											to be a skilled moral craftsman.
											And in interactions with people,
											almost all the time,
											it is this kind of flexibility that is required.
											A wise person knows when to bend the rules.
											A wise person knows when to improvise.
											And most important,
											a wise person does this improvising and rule-bending
											in the service of the right aims.
											If you are a rule-bender and an improviser
											mostly to serve yourself,
											what you get is ruthless manipulation of other people.
											So it matters that you do this wise practice
											in the service of others
											and not in the service of yourself.
											And so the will to do the right thing
											is just as important as the moral skill
											of improvisation
											and exception-finding.
											Together they comprise practical wisdom,
											which Aristotle thought
											was the master virtue.

											So I&#39;ll give you an example
											of wise practice in action.
											It&#39;s the case of Michael.
											Michael&#39;s a young guy.
											He had a pretty low-wage job.
											He was supporting his wife and a child,
											and the child was going to parochial school.
											Then he lost his job.
											He panicked
											about being able to support his family.
											One night, he drank a little too much,
											and he robbed a cab driver —
											stole 50 dollars.
											He robbed him at gunpoint.
											It was a toy gun.
											He got caught. He got tried.
											He got convicted.
											The Pennsylvania sentencing guidelines
											required a minimum sentence for a crime like this
											of two years, 24 months.
											The judge on the case, Judge Lois Forer
											thought that this made no sense.
											He had never committed a crime before.
											He was a responsible husband and father.
											He had been faced with desperate circumstances.
											All this would do is wreck a family.
											And so she improvised a sentence — 11 months,
											and not only that,
											but release every day to go to work.
											Spend your night in jail, spend your day holding down a job.
											He did. He served out his sentence.
											He made restitution
											and found himself a new job.
											And the family was united.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And it seemed on the road
											to some sort of a decent life —
											a happy ending to a story
											involving wise improvisation
											from a wise judge.
											But it turned out
											the prosecutor was not happy
											that Judge Forer ignored the sentencing guidelines
											and sort of invented her own,
											and so he appealed.
											And he asked for the mandatory minimum sentence
											for armed robbery.
											He did after all have a toy gun.
											The mandatory minimum sentence for armed robbery
											is five years.
											He won the appeal.
											Michael was sentenced to five years in prison.
											Judge Forer had to follow the law.
											And by the way, this appeal went through
											after he had finished serving his sentence,
											so he was out and working at a job
											and taking care of his family
											and he had to go back into jail.
											Judge Forer did what she was required to do,
											and then she quit the bench.
											And Michael disappeared.
											So that is an example,
											both of wisdom in practice
											and the subversion of wisdom
											by rules that are meant, of course, to make things better.

									<p>
											Now consider Ms. Dewey.
											Ms. Dewey&#39;s a teacher in a Texas elementary school.
											She found herself listening to a consultant one day
											who was trying to help teachers
											boost the test scores of the kids,
											so that the school
											would reach the elite category
											in percentage of kids passing big tests.
											All these schools in Texas compete with one another
											to achieve these milestones,
											and there are bonuses and various other treats
											that come if you beat the other schools.
											So here was the consultant&#39;s advice:
											first, don&#39;t waste your time on kids
											who are going to pass the test no matter what you do.
											Second, don&#39;t waste your time
											on kids who can&#39;t pass the test
											no matter what you do.
											Third, don&#39;t waste your time
											on kids who moved into the district
											too late for their scores to be counted.
											Focus all of your time and attention
											on the kids who are on the bubble,
											the so-called &quot;bubble kids&quot; —
											kids where your intervention
											can get them just maybe over the line
											from failing to passing.
											So Ms. Dewey heard this,
											and she shook her head in despair
											while fellow teachers were sort of cheering each other on
											and nodding approvingly.
											It&#39;s like they were about to go play a football game.
											For Ms. Dewey,
											this isn&#39;t why she became a teacher.

											Now Ken and I are not naive,
											and we understand that you need to have rules.
											You need to have incentives.
											People have to make a living.
											But the problem
											with relying on rules and incentives
											is that they demoralize
											professional activity,
											and they demoralize professional activity
											in two senses.
											First, they demoralize the people
											who are engaged in the activity.
											Judge Forer quits,
											and Ms. Dewey in completely disheartened.
											And second,
											they demoralize the activity itself.
											The very practice is demoralized,
											and the practitioners are demoralized.
											It creates people —
											when you manipulate incentives to get people to do the right thing —
											it creates people
											who are addicted to incentives.
											That is to say, it creates people
											who only do things for incentives.

									<p>
											Now the striking thing about this
											is that psychologists have known this
											for 30 years.
											Psychologists have known
											about the negative consequences of incentivizing everything
											for 30 years.
											We know that if you reward kids for drawing pictures,
											they stop caring about the drawing
											and care only about the reward.
											If you reward kids for reading books,
											they stop caring about what&#39;s in the books
											and only care about how long they are.
											If you reward teachers for kids&#39; test scores,
											they stop caring about educating
											and only care about test preparation.
											If you were to reward doctors
											for doing more procedures —
											which is the current system — they would do more.
											If instead you reward doctors for doing fewer procedures,
											they will do fewer.
											What we want, of course,
											is doctors who do just the right amount of procedures
											and do the right amount for the right reason —
											namely, to serve the welfare of their patients.
											Psychologists have known this for decades,
											and it&#39;s time for policymakers
											to start paying attention
											and listen to psychologists a little bit,

											And it doesn&#39;t have to be this way.
											We think, Ken and I, that there are real sources of hope.
											We identify one set of people
											in all of these practices
											who we call canny outlaws.
											These are people
											who, being forced to operate
											in a system that demands rule-following
											and creates incentives,
											find away around the rules,
											find a way to subvert the rules.
											So there are teachers who have these scripts to follow,
											and they know that if they follow these scripts, the kids will learn nothing.
											And so what they do is they follow the scripts,
											but they follow the scripts at double-time
											and squirrel away little bits of extra time
											during which they teach in the way
											that they actually know is effective.
											So these are little ordinary, everyday heroes,
											and they&#39;re incredibly admirable,
											but there&#39;s no way that they can sustain this kind of activity
											in the face of a system
											that either roots them out
											or grinds them down.

											So canny outlaws are better than nothing,
											but it&#39;s hard to imagine any canny outlaw

											More hopeful
											are people we call system-changers.
											These are people who are looking
											not to dodge the system&#39;s rules and regulations,
											but to transform the system,
											and we talk about several.
											One in particular
											is a judge named Robert Russell.
											And one day he was faced
											with the case of Gary Pettengill.
											Pettengill was a 23-year-old vet
											who had planned to make the army a career,
											but then he got a severe back injury in Iraq,
											and that forced him to take a medical discharge.
											He was married, he had a third kid on the way,
											he suffered from PTSD, in addition to the bad back,
											and recurrent nightmares,
											and he had started using marijuana
											to ease some of the symptoms.
											He was only able to get part-time work because of his back,
											and so he was unable to earn enough to put food on the table
											and take care of his family.
											So he started selling marijuana.
											He was busted in a drug sweep.
											His family was kicked out of their apartment,
											and the welfare system
											was threatening to take away his kids.

									<p>
											Under normal sentencing procedures,
											Judge Russell would have had little choice
											but to sentence Pettengill to serious jail-time
											as a drug felon.
											But Judge Russell did have an alternative.
											And that&#39;s because he was in a special court.
											He was in a court called the Veterans&#39; Court.
											In the Veterans&#39; Court —
											this was the first of its kind in the United States.
											Judge Russell created the Veterans&#39; Court.
											It was a court only for veterans
											who had broken the law.
											And he had created it exactly because
											mandatory sentencing laws
											were taking the judgment out of judging.
											No one wanted non-violent offenders —
											and especially non-violent offenders who were veterans to boot —
											to be thrown into prison.
											They wanted to do something about what we all know,
											namely the revolving door of the criminal justice system.
											And what the Veterans&#39; Court did,
											was it treated each criminal as an individual,
											tried to get inside their problems,
											tried to fashion responses to their crimes
											that helped them to rehabilitate themselves,
											and didn&#39;t forget about them once the judgment was made.
											Stayed with them, followed up on them,
											made sure that they were sticking to whatever plan
											had been jointly developed
											to get them over the hump.

											There are now 22 cities

											that Judge Russell
											has now seen 108 vets
											in his Veterans&#39; Court
											as of February of this year,
											and out of 108,
											guess how many have gone back through
											the revolving door of justice
											into prison.
											None. None.
											Anyone would glom onto

											So there are examples like this in medicine —
											doctors at Harvard
											who are trying to transform medical education,
											so that you don&#39;t get a kind of ethical erosion
											and loss of empathy,
											which characterizes most medical students
											in the course of their medical training.
											And the way they do it is to give third-year medical students
											patients who they follow for an entire year.
											So the patients are not organ systems,
											and they&#39;re not diseases;
											they&#39;re people, people with lives.
											And in order to be an effective doctor,
											you need to treat people who have lives and not just disease.
											In addition to which there&#39;s an enormous amount of back and forth,

											and the result is a generation — we hope — of doctors
											who do have time for the people they treat.
											We&#39;ll see.

											So there are lots of examples like this that we talk about.
											Each of them shows that it is possible
											to build on and nurture character
											and keep a profession
											true to its proper mission —
											what Aristotle would have called its proper telos.
											And Ken and I believe
											that this is what practitioners actually want.
											People want to be allowed
											to be virtuous.
											They want to have permission to do the right thing.
											They don&#39;t want to feel
											like they need to take a shower
											to get the moral grime off their bodies everyday
											when they come home from work.

											Aristotle thought that practical wisdom
											was the key to happiness,
											and he was right.
											There&#39;s now a lot of research being done in psychology
											on what makes people happy,
											and the two things that jump out in study after study —
											I know this will come as a shock to all of you —
											the two things that matter most to happiness
											are love and work.
											Love: managing successfully
											relations with the people who are close to you
											and with the communities of which you are a part.
											Work: engaging in activities
											that are meaningful and satisfying.
											If you have that, good close relations with other people,
											work that&#39;s meaningful and fulfilling,
											you don&#39;t much need anything else.

									<p>
											Well, to love well and to work well,
											you need wisdom.
											Rules and incentives don&#39;t tell you
											how to be a good friend, how to be a good parent,
											how to be a good spouse,
											or how to be a good doctor or a good lawyer
											or a good teacher.
											Rules and incentives
											are no substitutes for wisdom.
											Indeed, we argue,
											there is no substitute for wisdom.
											And so practical wisdom
											does not require
											heroic acts of self-sacrifice
											on the part of practitioners.
											In giving us the will and the skill
											to do the right thing — to do right by others —
											practical wisdom also gives us
											the will and the skill
											to do right by ourselves.

Lately, working with Ken Sharpe, he's studying wisdom.","whylisten":"<p>In his 2004 book <a href=\"http://geni.us/paradoxofchoice\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Paradox of Choice</em></a>, Barry Schwartz tackles one of the great mysteries of modern life: Why is it that societies of great abundance &mdash; where individuals are offered more freedom and choice (personal, professional, material) than ever before &mdash; are now witnessing a near-epidemic of depression? <strong>Conventional wisdom tells us that greater choice is for the greater good, but Schwartz argues the opposite</strong>: He makes a compelling case that the abundance of choice in today&#39;s western world is actually making us miserable. <br /><br /><strong>Infinite choice is paralyzing, Schwartz argues, and exhausting to the human psyche. </strong>It leads us to set unreasonably high expectations, question our choices before we even make them and blame our failures entirely on ourselves. His relatable examples, from consumer products (jeans, TVs, salad dressings) to lifestyle choices (where to live, what job to take, who and when to marry), underscore this central point: Too much choice undermines happiness.<br /><br />Schwartz&#39;s previous research has addressed morality, decision-making and the varied inter-relationships between science and society. Before <em>Paradox</em> he published <a href=\"http://geni.us/costofliving\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Costs of Living</em></a>, which traces the impact of free-market thinking on the explosion of consumerism -- and <strong>the effect of the new capitalism on social and cultural institutions that once operated above the market, such as medicine, sports, and the law</strong>.<br /><br />Both books level serious criticism of modern western society, illuminating the under-reported psychological plagues of our time. But they also offer <strong>concrete ideas on addressing the problems</strong>, from a personal and societal level.</p><p>Schwartz is the author of the TED Book,&nbsp;<a

Lately, working with Ken Sharpe, he's studying wisdom.","whylisten":"<p>In his 2004 book <a href=\"http://geni.us/paradoxofchoice\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Paradox of Choice</em></a>, Barry Schwartz tackles one of the great mysteries of modern life: Why is it that societies of great abundance &mdash; where individuals are offered more freedom and choice (personal, professional, material) than ever before &mdash; are now witnessing a near-epidemic of depression? <strong>Conventional wisdom tells us that greater choice is for the greater good, but Schwartz argues the opposite</strong>: He makes a compelling case that the abundance of choice in today&#39;s western world is actually making us miserable. <br /><br /><strong>Infinite choice is paralyzing, Schwartz argues, and exhausting to the human psyche. </strong>It leads us to set unreasonably high expectations, question our choices before we even make them and blame our failures entirely on ourselves. His relatable examples, from consumer products (jeans, TVs, salad dressings) to lifestyle choices (where to live, what job to take, who and when to marry), underscore this central point: Too much choice undermines happiness.<br /><br />Schwartz&#39;s previous research has addressed morality, decision-making and the varied inter-relationships between science and society. Before <em>Paradox</em> he published <a href=\"http://geni.us/costofliving\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Costs of Living</em></a>, which traces the impact of free-market thinking on the explosion of consumerism -- and <strong>the effect of the new capitalism on social and cultural institutions that once operated above the market, such as medicine, sports, and the law</strong>.<br /><br />Both books level serious criticism of modern western society, illuminating the under-reported psychological plagues of our time. But they also offer <strong>concrete ideas on addressing the problems</strong>, from a personal and societal level.</p><p>Schwartz is the author of the TED Book,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://geni.us/whyweworkintl\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Why We Work</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>"}],"speaker_name":"Barry Schwartz","tags":["culture","global issues","happiness","philosophy","self"],"title":"Using our practical wisdom","video_type":{"id":"1","name":"TED Stage Talk"},"viewed_count":1114862}]}})</script></div>
