											On my desk in my office, I keep a small clay pot
											that I made in college. It&#39;s raku, which is a kind of pottery
											that began in Japan centuries ago as a way of
											making bowls for the Japanese tea ceremony.
											This one is more than 400 years old.
											Each one was pinched or carved out of a ball of clay,
											and it was the imperfections that people cherished.

									<p>
											Everyday pots like this cup take eight to 10 hours to fire.
											I just took this out of the kiln last week, and the kiln itself
											takes another day or two to cool down, but raku
											is really fast. You do it outside, and you take the kiln
											up to temperature. In 15 minutes, it goes to 1,500 degrees,
											and as soon as you see that the glaze has melted inside,
											you can see that faint sheen, you turn the kiln off,
											and you reach in with these long metal tongs,
											you grab the pot, and in Japan, this red-hot pot
											would be immediately immersed in a solution of green tea,
											and you can imagine what that steam would smell like.
											But here in the United States, we ramp up the drama
											a little bit, and we drop our pots into sawdust,
											which catches on fire, and you take a garbage pail,
											and you put it on top, and smoke starts pouring out.
											I would come home with my clothes reeking of woodsmoke.

											I love raku because it allows me to play with the elements.
											I can shape a pot out of clay and choose a glaze,
											but then I have to let it go to the fire and the smoke,
											and what&#39;s wonderful is the surprises that happen,
											like this crackle pattern, because it&#39;s really stressful
											on these pots. They go from 1,500 degrees
											to room temperature in the space of just a minute.

											Raku is a wonderful metaphor for the process of creativity.
											I find in so many things that tension between
											what I can control and what I have to let go
											happens all the time, whether I&#39;m creating a new radio show
											or just at home negotiating with my teenage sons.

											When I sat down to write a book about creativity,
											I realized that the steps were reversed.
											I had to let go at the very beginning, and I had to
											immerse myself in the stories of hundreds of artists
											and writers and musicians and filmmakers, and as I listened
											to these stories, I realized that creativity
											grows out of everyday experiences
											more often than you might think, including
											letting go.
											It was supposed to break, but that&#39;s okay. (Laughter) (Laughs)
											That&#39;s part of the letting go, is sometimes it happens
											and sometimes it doesn&#39;t, because creativity also grows
											from the broken places.

											The best way to learn about anything
											is through stories, and so I want to tell you a story
											about work and play and about four aspects of life
											that we need to embrace
											in order for our own creativity to flourish.
											The first embrace is something that we think,
											&quot;Oh, this is very easy,&quot; but it&#39;s actually getting harder,
											and that&#39;s paying attention to the world around us.
											So many artists speak about needing to be open,
											to embrace experience, and that&#39;s hard to do when
											you have a lighted rectangle in your pocket that
											takes all of your focus.

											The filmmaker Mira Nair speaks about growing up
											in a small town in India. Its name is Bhubaneswar,
											and here&#39;s a picture of one of the temples in her town.

									<p>
											Mira Nair: In this little town, there were like 2,000 temples.
											We played cricket all the time. We kind of grew up
											in the rubble. The major thing that inspired me,
											that led me on this path, that made me a filmmaker eventually,
											was traveling folk theater that would come through the town
											and I would go off and see these great battles
											of good and evil by two people in a school field
											with no props but with a lot of, you know,
											passion, and hashish as well, and it was amazing.
											You know, the folk tales of Mahabharata and Ramayana,
											the two holy books, the epics that everything comes out of
											in India, they say. After seeing that Jatra, the folk theater,
											I knew I wanted to get on, you know, and perform.

											Julie Burstein: Isn&#39;t that a wonderful story?
											You can see the sort of break in the everyday.
											There they are in the school fields, but it&#39;s good and evil,
											and passion and hashish. And Mira Nair was a young girl
											with thousands of other people watching this performance,
											but she was ready. She was ready to open up
											to what it sparked in her, and it led her,
											as she said, down this path to become
											an award-winning filmmaker.
											So being open for that experience that might change you
											is the first thing we need to embrace.

											Artists also speak about how some of their most powerful work
											comes out of the parts of life that are most difficult.
											The novelist Richard Ford speaks about
											a childhood challenge that continues to be something
											he wrestles with today. He&#39;s severely dyslexic.

											Richard Ford: I was slow to learn to read, went all the way
											through school not really reading more than the minimum,
											and still to this day can&#39;t read silently
											much faster than I can read aloud,
											but there were a lot of benefits to being dyslexic for me
											because when I finally did reconcile myself to how slow
											I was going to have to do it, then I think I came very slowly
											into an appreciation of all of those qualities of language
											and of sentences that are not just the cognitive
											aspects of language: the syncopations, the sounds of words,
											what words look like, where paragraphs break,
											where lines break. I mean, I wasn&#39;t so badly dyslexic that
											I was disabled from reading. I just had to do it
											really slowly, and as I did, lingering on those sentences
											as I had to linger, I fell heir to language&#39;s other qualities,
											which I think has helped me write sentences.

											JB: It&#39;s so powerful. Richard Ford, who&#39;s won the Pulitzer Prize,
											says that dyslexia helped him write sentences.
											He had to embrace this challenge, and I use that word

											He had to learn from it. He had to learn to hear the music
											in language.

											Artists also speak about how pushing up against
											the limits of what they can do, sometimes pushing
											into what they can&#39;t do, helps them focus
											on finding their own voice.
											The sculptor Richard Serra talks about how,
											as a young artist, he thought he was a painter,
											and he lived in Florence after graduate school.
											While he was there, he traveled to Madrid,
											where he went to the Prado to see this picture
											by the Spanish painter Diego Velázquez.
											It&#39;s from 1656, and it&#39;s called &quot;Las Meninas,&quot;
											and it&#39;s the picture of a little princess
											and her ladies-in-waiting, and if you look over
											that little blonde princess&#39;s shoulder, you&#39;ll see a mirror,
											and reflected in it are her parents, the King and Queen
											of Spain, who would be standing where you might stand
											to look at the picture.
											As he often did, Velázquez put himself in this painting too.
											He&#39;s standing on the left with his paintbrush in one hand
											and his palette in the other.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">

											Richard Serra: I was standing there looking at it,
											and I realized that Velázquez was looking at me,
											and I thought, &quot;Oh. I&#39;m the subject of the painting.&quot;
											And I thought, &quot;I&#39;m not going to be able to do that painting.&quot;
											I was to the point where I was using a stopwatch
											and painting squares out of randomness,
											and I wasn&#39;t getting anywhere. So I went back and dumped
											all my paintings in the Arno, and I thought, I&#39;m going to just start playing around.
									</p>
								</div>

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">

											JB: Richard Serra says that so nonchalantly, you might
											have missed it. He went and saw this painting by a guy
											who&#39;d been dead for 300 years, and realized,
											&quot;I can&#39;t do that,&quot; and so Richard Serra went back
											to his studio in Florence, picked up all of his work
											up to that point, and threw it in a river.
											Richard Serra let go of painting at that moment,
											but he didn&#39;t let go of art. He moved to New York City,
											and he put together a list of verbs
											— to roll, to crease, to fold —
											more than a hundred of them, and as he said,
											he just started playing around. He did these things
											to all kinds of material. He would take a huge sheet of lead
											and roll it up and unroll it. He would do the same thing
											to rubber, and when he got to the direction &quot;to lift,&quot;
											he created this, which is in the Museum of Modern Art.
											Richard Serra had to let go of painting
											in order to embark on this playful exploration
											that led him to the work that he&#39;s known for today:
											huge curves of steel that require our time and motion
											to experience. In sculpture,
											Richard Serra is able to do what he couldn&#39;t do in painting.
											He makes us the subject of his art.
											So experience and challenge
											and limitations are all things we need to embrace
											for creativity to flourish.

											There&#39;s a fourth embrace, and it&#39;s the hardest.
											It&#39;s the embrace of loss,
											the oldest and most constant of human experiences.
											In order to create, we have to stand in that space
											between what we see in the world and what we hope for,
											looking squarely at rejection, at heartbreak,
											at war, at death.
											That&#39;s a tough space to stand in.
											The educator Parker Palmer calls it &quot;the tragic gap,&quot;
											tragic not because it&#39;s sad but because it&#39;s inevitable,
											and my friend Dick Nodel likes to say,
											&quot;You can hold that tension like a violin string
											and make something beautiful.&quot;

											That tension resonates in the work of the photographer
											Joel Meyerowitz, who at the beginning of his career was
											known for his street photography, for capturing a moment
											on the street, and also for his beautiful photographs
											of landscapes — of Tuscany, of Cape Cod,
											of light.
											Joel is a New Yorker, and his studio for many years
											was in Chelsea, with a straight view downtown
											to the World Trade Center, and he photographed
											those buildings in every sort of light.
											You know where this story goes.
											On 9/11, Joel wasn&#39;t in New York. He was out of town,
											but he raced back to the city, and raced down to the site
											of the destruction.

											Joel Meyerowitz: And like all the other passersby,
											I stood outside the chain link fence on Chambers
											and Greenwich, and all I could see was the smoke
											and a little bit of rubble, and I raised my camera
											to take a peek, just to see if there was something to see,
											and some cop, a lady cop, hit me on my shoulder,
											and said, &quot;Hey, no pictures!&quot;
											And it was such a blow that it woke me up,
											in the way that it was meant to be, I guess.
											And when I asked her why no pictures, she said,
											&quot;It&#39;s a crime scene. No photographs allowed.&quot;
											And I asked her, &quot;What would happen if I was a member
											of the press?&quot; And she told me,
											&quot;Oh, look back there,&quot; and back a block was the press corps
											tied up in a little penned-in area,
											and I said, &quot;Well, when do they go in?&quot;
											and she said, &quot;Probably never.&quot;
											And as I walked away from that, I had this crystallization,
											probably from the blow, because it was an insult in a way.
											I thought, &quot;Oh, if there&#39;s no pictures,
											then there&#39;ll be no record. We need a record.&quot;
											And I thought, &quot;I&#39;m gonna make that record.
											I&#39;ll find a way to get in, because I don&#39;t want to
											see this history disappear.&quot;

											JB: He did. He pulled in every favor he could,

											Looking at these photographs today brings back
											the smell of smoke that lingered on my clothes
											when I went home to my family at night.
											My office was just a few blocks away.

											JM: Well, you know, ugly, I mean, powerful
											and tragic and horrific and everything, but
											it was also as, in nature, an enormous event
											that was transformed after the fact into this residue,
											and like many other ruins
											— you go to the ruins of the Colosseum or the ruins of a cathedral someplace —
											and they take on a new meaning when you watch the weather.
											I mean, there were afternoons I was down there,
											and the light goes pink and there&#39;s a mist in the air
											and you&#39;re standing in the rubble, and I found myself
											recognizing both the inherent beauty of nature
											and the fact that nature, as time,
											is erasing this wound.
											Time is unstoppable, and it transforms the event.
											It gets further and further away from the day,
											and light and seasons temper it in some way,
											and it&#39;s not that I&#39;m a romantic. I&#39;m really a realist.
											The reality is, there&#39;s the Woolworth Building
											in a veil of smoke from the site, but it&#39;s now like a scrim
											across a theater, and it&#39;s turning pink,
											you know, and down below there are hoses spraying,
											and the lights have come on for the evening, and the water
											is turning acid green because the sodium lamps are on,

											I want to leave you with another
											image of a Japanese tea bowl. This one
											is at the Freer Gallery in Washington, D.C.
											It&#39;s more than a hundred years old and you can still see
											the fingermarks where the potter pinched it.
											But as you can also see, this one did break
											at some point in its hundred years.
											But the person who put it back together,
											instead of hiding the cracks,
											decided to emphasize them, using gold lacquer to repair it.
											This bowl is more beautiful now, having been broken,
											than it was when it was first made,
											and we can look at those cracks, because
											they tell the story that we all live,
											of the cycle of creation and destruction,
											of control and letting go, of picking up the pieces
											and making something new.
											Thank you. (Applause)
