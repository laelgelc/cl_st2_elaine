											On simplicity. What a great way to start.
											First of all, I&#39;ve been watching this trend
											where we have these books like such and such &quot;For Dummies.&quot;
											Do you know these books, these such and such &quot;For Dummies?&quot;
											My daughters pointed out that I&#39;m very similar looking, so this is a bit of a problem.
											(Laughter)
											But I was looking online at Amazon.com for other books like this.
											You know, there&#39;s also something called the &quot;Complete Idiot&#39;s Guide?&quot;
											There&#39;s a sort of business model around being stupid in some sense.
											We like to have technology make us feel bad, for some strange reason.

									<p>
											But I really like that, so I wrote a book called &quot;The Laws of Simplicity.&quot;
											I was in Milan last week, for the Italian launch.
											It&#39;s kind of a book about questions, questions about simplicity.
											Very few answers. I&#39;m also wondering myself, what is simplicity?
											Is it good? Is it bad? Is complexity better? I&#39;m not sure.

									<p>
											After I wrote &quot;The Laws of Simplicity,&quot;
											I was very tired of simplicity, as you can imagine.
											And so in my life, I&#39;ve discovered that
											vacation is the most important skill for any kind of over-achiever.
											Because your companies will always take away your life,
											but they can never take away your vacation — in theory.

											So, I went to the Cape last summer to hide from simplicity,
											and I went to the Gap, because I only have black pants.
											So I went and bought khaki shorts or whatever,
											and unfortunately, their branding was all about &quot;Keep It Simple.&quot;
											(Laughter)
											I opened up a magazine, and Visa&#39;s branding was,
											&quot;Business Takes Simplicity.&quot;
											I develop photographs, and Kodak said, &quot;Keep It Simple.&quot;
											So, I felt kind of weird that simplicity was sort of following me around.

											So, I turned on the TV, and I don&#39;t watch TV very much,
											but you know this person? This is Paris Hilton, apparently.
											And she has this show, &quot;The Simple Life.&quot;
											So I watched this. It&#39;s not very simple, a little bit confusing.
											(Laughter)
											So, I looked for a different show to watch.
											So, I opened up this TV Guide thing,
											and on the E! channel, this &quot;Simple Life&quot; show is very popular.
											They&#39;ll play it over, and over, and over.

											So, I wanted to escape again, so I went out to my car.
											And Cape Cod, there are idyllic roads, and all of us can drive in this room.
											And when you drive, these signs are very important.
											It&#39;s a very simple sign, it says, &quot;road&quot; and &quot;road approaching.&quot;
											So I&#39;m mostly driving along, okay, and then I saw this sign.
											(Laughter)
											So, I thought complexity was attacking me suddenly,

											But looking way back, when I was a child —
											you see, I grew up in a tofu factory in Seattle.
											Many of you may not like tofu because you haven&#39;t had good tofu,
											but tofu&#39;s a good food. It&#39;s a very simple kind of food.
											It&#39;s very hard work to make tofu.
											As a child, we used to wake up at 1 a.m. and work till 6 p.m., six days a week.

											When I was in Japan — I went to an art school in Japan —

											The great graphic designer Paul Rand
											designed the IBM logo, the Westinghouse logo.
											He basically said, &quot;I&#39;ve designed everything.&quot;
											And also Ikko Tanaka was a very important mentor in my life —

											When you have mentors — and yesterday,
											Kareem Abdul-Jabbar talked about mentors,
											these people in your life — the problem with mentors is that they all die.
											This is a sad thing, but it&#39;s actually a happy thing in a way,
											because you can remember them in their pure form.
											I think that the mentors that we all meet sort of humanize us.
											When you get older, and you&#39;re all freaked out, whatever,

											Because the human thing is very hard when you&#39;re at MIT.
											The T doesn&#39;t stand for &quot;human,&quot; it stands for &quot;technology.&quot;
											And because of that, I always wondered about this human thing.
											So, I&#39;ve always been Googling this word, &quot;human,&quot;
											to find out how many hits I get.
											And in 2001, I had 26 million hits, and for &quot;computer,&quot;
											because computers are against humans a bit,

											I have 42 million hits. Let me do an Al Gore here.
											So, if you sort of compare that, like this,
											you&#39;ll see that computer versus human —
											I&#39;ve been tracking this for the last year —
											computer versus human over the last year has changed.
											It used to be kind of two to one. Now, humans are catching up.
											Very good, us humans! We&#39;re catching up with the computers.
											In the simplicity realm, it&#39;s also interesting.
											So if you compare complexities to simplicity,
											it&#39;s also catching up in a way, too.
											So, somehow humans and simplicity are intertwined, I think.

											I have a confession: I&#39;m not a man of simplicity.
											I spent my entire early career making complex stuff.
											Lots of complex stuff.
											I wrote computer programs to make complex graphics like this.
											I had clients in Japan to make really complex stuff like this.
											And I&#39;ve always felt bad about it, in a sense.
											So, I hid in a time dimension.
											I built things in a time-graphics dimension.
											I did this series of calendars for Shiseido.
											This is a floral theme calendar in 1997,
											and this is a firework calendar. So, you launch the number into space,
											because the Japanese believe that when you see fireworks,
											you&#39;re cooler for some reason.
											This is why they have fireworks in the summer.
											A very extreme culture.
											Lastly, this is a fall-based calendar,
											because I have so many leaves in my yard.
											So this is the leaves in my yard, essentially.

											I&#39;ve been lucky to have been there before people made these kind of things,

											Tomorrow, Paola Antonelli is speaking. I love Paola.

											&quot;Eye candy&quot; — sort of pejorative, don&#39;t you think?

											I&#39;ve been interested in computer programs all my life, actually.
											Computer programs are essentially trees,
											and when you make art with a computer program, there&#39;s kind of a problem.
											Whenever you make art with a computer program,
											you&#39;re always on the tree, and the paradox is that
											for excellent art, you want to be off the tree.

											I took these to Tokyo in 2001 to make computer objects.
											This is a new way to type, on my old, color Classic.
											You can&#39;t type very much on this.
											I also discovered that an IR mouse responds to CRT emissions
											and starts to move by itself, so this is a self-drawing machine.
											And also, one year, the G3 Bondi Blue thing —
											that caddy would come out, like, dangerous, like, &quot;whack,&quot; like that.
											But I thought, &quot;This is very interesting. What if I make like a car crash test?&quot;
											So I have a crash test.

											Shortly after this, 9/11 happened, and I was very depressed.
											I was concerned with contemporary art

											So I focused on food as my area —
											these sort of clementine peel things.
											In Japan, it&#39;s a wonderful thing to remove the clementine peel
											just in one piece. Who&#39;s done that before? One-piece clementine?
											Oh, you guys are missing out, if you haven&#39;t done it yet.
											It was very good, and I discovered I can make sculptures out of this,
											actually, in different forms.
											If you dry them quick, you can make, like, elephants and steers and stuff,

											When you want less, it&#39;s because it&#39;s about work.
											And so, to boil it all down, simplicity is about living life
											with more enjoyment and less pain.
											I think this is sort of simple more versus less.
											Basically, it always depends.
											This book I wrote because I want to figure out life.
											I love life. I love being alive. I like to see things.
											And so life is a big question, I think, in simplicity,
											because you&#39;re trying to simplify your life.

											And I just love to see the world. The world is an amazing place.
											By being at TED, we see so many things at one time.
											And I can&#39;t help but enjoy looking at everything in the world.
											Like everything you see, every time you wake up.
											It&#39;s such a joy to sort of experience everything in the world.
											From everything from a weird hotel lobby,
											to Saran wrap placed over your window,
											to this moment where I had my road in front of my house paved dark black,
											and this white moth was sitting there dying in the sun.

											And so, this whole thing has struck me as exciting to be here,
											because life is finite.
											This was given to me by the chairman of Shiseido.
											He&#39;s an expert in aging. This horizontal axis is how old you are —
											twelve years old, twenty-four years old, seventy-four, ninety-six years old —
											and this is some medical data. So, brain strength increases up to 60,
											and then after 60, it sort of goes down. Kind of depressing in a way.

									<p>
											Also, if you look at your physical strength.
											You know, I have a lot of cocky freshmen at MIT, so I tell them,
											&quot;Oh, your bodies are really getting stronger and stronger,
											but in your late twenties and mid-thirties, cells, they die.&quot;
											OK. It gets them to work harder, sometimes.
											And if you have your vision, vision is interesting.
											As you age from infant age, your vision gets better,
											and maybe in your late teens, early twenties, you&#39;re looking for a mate,
											and your vision goes after that.

									<p>
											Your social responsibility is very interesting.
											So, as you get older, you may, like, have kids, whatever.
											And then the kids graduate, and you have no responsibility any more —
											that&#39;s very good, too.

									<p>
											But if any of you people ask,
											&quot;What actually goes up? Does anything go up?
											What&#39;s the positive part of this, you know?&quot; I think wisdom always goes up.
											I love these eighty-year-old, ninety-year-old guys and women.
											They have so many thoughts, and they have so much wisdom,
											and I think — you know, this TED thing, I&#39;ve come here.
											And this is the fourth time, and I come here for this wisdom, I think.
											This whole TED effect, it sort of ups your wisdom, somehow.
											And I&#39;m so glad to be here, and I&#39;m very grateful to be here, Chris.
											And this is an amazing experience for me as well.

And when computer-aided design began to explode in the mid-1990s, Maeda was in a perfect position at the MIT Media Lab to influence and shape the form, helping typographers and page designers explore the freedom of the web.</p> <p>Maeda is leading the &quot;<a href=\"http://stemtosteam.org/\" target=\"_blank\">STEAM</a>&quot; movement--adding an &quot;A&quot; for Art to the education acronym&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.risd.edu/About/STEM_to_STEAM/\" target=\"_blank\">STEM</a>&nbsp;(Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math)--and experiencing firsthand the transformation brought by social media. After leaving his post as RISD&#39;s president, Maeda is turning his attention to Silicon Valley, where is is working as a Design Partner for <a href=\"https://kpcb.com/news/john-maeda-joins-kleiner-perkins-caufield-byers-as-design-partner\" target=\"_blank\">Kleiner, Perkins, Caulfield and Byers.</a>  He is also consulting for eBay, where he is the chair of the Design Advisory Board. </p>"}],"speaker_name":"John Maeda","tags":["art","design","simplicity","technology"],"title":"Designing for simplicity","video_type":{"id":"1","name":"TED Stage Talk"},"viewed_count":1484416}]}})</script></div>
