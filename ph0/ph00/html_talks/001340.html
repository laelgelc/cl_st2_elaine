<title>Sebastian Thrun and Chris Anderson: What AI is -- and isn&#39;t | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Educator and entrepreneur Sebastian Thrun wants us to use AI to free humanity of repetitive work and unleash our creativity. In an inspiring, informative conversation with TED Curator Chris Anderson, Thrun discusses the progress of deep learning, why we shouldn&#39;t fear runaway AI and how society will be better off if dull, tedious work is done with the help of machines. &quot;Only one percent of interesting things have been invented yet,&quot; Thrun says. &quot;I believe all of us are insanely creative ... [AI] will empower us to turn creativity into action.&quot;" />

<meta content='Educator and entrepreneur Sebastian Thrun wants us to use AI to free humanity of repetitive work and unleash our creativity. In an inspiring, informative conversation with TED Curator Chris Anderson, Thrun discusses the progress of deep learning, why we shouldn&#x0027;t fear runaway AI and how society will be better off if dull, tedious work is done with the help of machines. "Only one percent of interesting things have been invented yet," Thrun says. "I believe all of us are insanely creative ... [AI] will empower us to turn creativity into action."' itemprop='description'>

											Chris Anderson: Help us understand

											Sebastian Thrun: So, artificial
intelligence and machine learning
											is about 60 years old
											and has not had a great day
in its past until recently.
											And the reason is that today,
											we have reached a scale
of computing and datasets
											that was necessary to make machines smart.
											So here&#39;s how it works.
											If you program a computer today,
say, your phone,
											then you hire software engineers
											that write a very,
very long kitchen recipe,
											like, &quot;If the water is too hot,
turn down the temperature.
											If it&#39;s too cold, turn up
the temperature.&quot;
											The recipes are not just 10 lines long.
											They are millions of lines long.
											A modern cell phone
has 12 million lines of code.
											A browser has five million lines of code.
											And each bug in this recipe
can cause your computer to crash.
											That&#39;s why a software engineer
makes so much money.
											The new thing now is that computers
can find their own rules.
											So instead of an expert
deciphering, step by step,
											a rule for every contingency,
											what you do now is you give
the computer examples
											and have it infer its own rules.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											A really good example is AlphaGo,
which recently was won by Google.
											Normally, in game playing,
you would really write down all the rules,
											but in AlphaGo&#39;s case,
											the system looked over a million games
											and was able to infer its own rules
											and then beat the world&#39;s
residing Go champion.
											That is exciting, because it relieves
the software engineer
											of the need of being super smart,
											and pushes the burden towards the data.
											As I said, the inflection point
where this has become really possible —
											very embarrassing, my thesis
was about machine learning.
											It was completely
insignificant, don&#39;t read it,
											because it was 20 years ago
											and back then, the computers
were as big as a cockroach brain.
											Now they are powerful enough
to really emulate
											kind of specialized human thinking.
											And then the computers
take advantage of the fact
											that they can look at
much more data than people can.
											So I&#39;d say AlphaGo looked at
more than a million games.
											No human expert can ever
study a million games.
											Google has looked at over
a hundred billion web pages.
											No person can ever study
a hundred billion web pages.
											So as a result,
the computer can find rules
											that even people can&#39;t find.

how you raise children.
											You don&#39;t spend the first 18 years
giving kids a rule for every contingency

											They stumble, fall, get up,
they get slapped or spanked,

a good grade in school,
											and they figure it out on their own.

so much easier all of a sudden.

how to steer this car?&quot;
											And if you look at the images,

to get the steering right.
											And we ran a competition and said,
&quot;It&#39;s a deep learning competition,
											AI competition,&quot;
											and we gave the students 48 hours.
											So if you are a software house
like Google or Facebook,
											something like this costs you
at least six months of work.
											So we figured 48 hours is great.
											And within 48 hours, we got about
100 submissions from students,

											It drives better than I could
drive on this imagery,
											using deep learning.

											It&#39;s this magical thing.

											ST: This is kind of an insight
into what&#39;s happening

											with people who are being paid
400,000 dollars a year,
											dermatologists,
											highly trained specialists.
											It takes more than a decade of training
to be a good dermatologist.
											What you see here is
the machine learning version of it.
											It&#39;s called a neural network.
											&quot;Neural networks&quot; is the technical term
for these machine learning algorithms.
											They&#39;ve been around since the 1980s.
											This one was invented in 1988
by a Facebook Fellow called Yann LeCun,
											and it propagates data stages
											through what you could think of
as the human brain.
											It&#39;s not quite the same thing,
but it emulates the same thing.
											It goes stage after stage.
											In the very first stage, it takes
the visual input and extracts edges
											and rods and dots.
											And the next one becomes
more complicated edges
											and shapes like little half-moons.
											And eventually, it&#39;s able to build
really complicated concepts.
											Andrew Ng has been able to show
											that it&#39;s able to find
cat faces and dog faces

at Stanford has shown is that

											ST: This was last Thursday.
That&#39;s a moving piece.
											What we&#39;ve shown before and we published
in &quot;Nature&quot; earlier this year
											was this idea that we show
dermatologists images
											and our computer program images,
											and count how often they&#39;re right.
											But all these images are past images.
											They&#39;ve all been biopsied to make sure
we had the correct classification.
											This one wasn&#39;t.
											This one was actually done at Stanford
by one of our collaborators.
											The story goes that our collaborator,
											who is a world-famous dermatologist,
one of the three best, apparently,
											looked at this mole and said,
&quot;This is not skin cancer.&quot;
											And then he had
a second moment, where he said,
											&quot;Well, let me just check with the app.&quot;
											So he took out his iPhone
and ran our piece of software,
											our &quot;pocket dermatologist,&quot; so to speak,
											and the iPhone said: cancer.
											It said melanoma.
											And then he was confused.
											And he decided, &quot;OK, maybe I trust
the iPhone a little bit more than myself,&quot;
											and he sent it out to the lab
to get it biopsied.
											And it came up as an aggressive melanoma.
											So I think this might be the first time
that we actually found,
											in the practice of using deep learning,
											an actual person whose melanoma
would have gone unclassified,
											had it not been for deep learning.

that we sometimes confuse

											like, what feels like it gets
scary for people is when you have
											a computer that can, one,
rewrite its own code,
											so, it can create
multiple copies of itself,
											try a bunch of different code versions,
											possibly even at random,
											and then check them out and see
if a goal is achieved and improved.
											So, say the goal is to do better
on an intelligence test.
											You know, a computer
that&#39;s moderately good at that,
											you could try a million versions of that.
											You might find one that was better,
											and then, you know, repeat.
											And so the concern is that you get
some sort of runaway effect
											where everything is fine
on Thursday evening,
											and you come back into the lab
on Friday morning,
											and because of the speed
of computers and so forth,
											things have gone crazy, and suddenly —

											ST: I would say this is a possibility,
											but it&#39;s a very remote possibility.
											So let me just translate
what I heard you say.
											In the AlphaGo case,
we had exactly this thing:
											the computer would play
the game against itself
											and then learn new rules.
											And what machine learning is
is a rewriting of the rules.
											It&#39;s the rewriting of code.
											But I think there was
absolutely no concern
											that AlphaGo would take over the world.
											It can&#39;t even play chess.

											CA: No, no, no, but now,
these are all very single-domain things.
											But it&#39;s possible to imagine.
											I mean, we just saw a computer
that seemed nearly capable
											of passing a university entrance test,
											that can kind of — it can&#39;t read
and understand in the sense that we can,
											but it can certainly absorb all the text
											and maybe see increased
patterns of meaning.
											Isn&#39;t there a chance that,
as this broadens out,
											there could be a different
kind of runaway effect?

											ST: That&#39;s where
I draw the line, honestly.
											And the chance exists —
I don&#39;t want to downplay it —
											but I think it&#39;s remote, and it&#39;s not
the thing that&#39;s on my mind these days,
											because I think the big revolution
is something else.
											Everything successful in AI
to the present date
											has been extremely specialized,
											and it&#39;s been thriving on a single idea,
											which is massive amounts of data.
											The reason AlphaGo works so well
is because of massive numbers of Go plays,
											and AlphaGo can&#39;t drive a car
or fly a plane.
											The Google self-driving car
or the Udacity self-driving car
											thrives on massive amounts of data,
and it can&#39;t do anything else.
											It can&#39;t even control a motorcycle.
											It&#39;s a very specific,
domain-specific function,
											and the same is true for our cancer app.
											There has been almost no progress
on this thing called &quot;general AI,&quot;
											where you go to an AI and say,
&quot;Hey, invent for me special relativity
											or string theory.&quot;
											It&#39;s totally in the infancy.

											The reason I want to emphasize this,
											I see the concerns,
and I want to acknowledge them.
											But if I were to think about one thing,
											I would ask myself the question,
&quot;What if we can take anything repetitive
											and make ourselves
100 times as efficient?&quot;
											It so turns out, 300 years ago,
we all worked in agriculture
											and did farming and did repetitive things.
											Today, 75 percent of us work in offices
											and do repetitive things.
											We&#39;ve become spreadsheet monkeys.
											And not just low-end labor.
											We&#39;ve become dermatologists
doing repetitive things,
											lawyers doing repetitive things.
											I think we are at the brink
of being able to take an AI,
											look over our shoulders,
											and they make us maybe 10 or 50 times
as effective in these repetitive things.
											That&#39;s what is on my mind.

									<p>
											CA: That sounds super exciting.
											The process of getting there seems
a little terrifying to some people,
											because once a computer
can do this repetitive thing
											much better than the dermatologist
											or than the driver, especially,
is the thing that&#39;s talked about
											so much now,
											suddenly millions of jobs go,
											and, you know, the country&#39;s in revolution
											before we ever get to the more
glorious aspects of what&#39;s possible.

											ST: Yeah, and that&#39;s an issue,
and it&#39;s a big issue,
											and it was pointed out yesterday morning
by several guest speakers.
											Now, prior to me showing up onstage,
											I confessed I&#39;m a positive,
optimistic person,
											so let me give you an optimistic pitch,
											which is, think of yourself
back 300 years ago.
											Europe just survived 140 years
of continuous war,
											none of you could read or write,
											there were no jobs that you hold today,
											like investment banker
or software engineer or TV anchor.
											We would all be in the fields and farming.
											Now here comes little Sebastian
with a little steam engine in his pocket,
											saying, &quot;Hey guys, look at this.
											It&#39;s going to make you 100 times
as strong, so you can do something else.&quot;
											And then back in the day,
there was no real stage,
											but Chris and I hang out
with the cows in the stable,
											and he says, &quot;I&#39;m really
concerned about it,
											because I milk my cow every day,
and what if the machine does this for me?&quot;

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											The reason why I mention this is,
											we&#39;re always good in acknowledging
past progress and the benefit of it,
											like our iPhones or our planes
or electricity or medical supply.
											We all love to live to 80,
which was impossible 300 years ago.
											But we kind of don&#39;t apply
the same rules to the future.
											So if I look at my own job as a CEO,
											I would say 90 percent
of my work is repetitive,
											I don&#39;t enjoy it,
											I spend about four hours per day
on stupid, repetitive email.
											And I&#39;m burning to have something
that helps me get rid of this.
											Why?
											Because I believe all of us
are insanely creative;
											I think the TED community
more than anybody else.
											But even blue-collar workers;
I think you can go to your hotel maid
											and have a drink with him or her,
											and an hour later,
you find a creative idea.
											What this will empower
is to turn this creativity into action.
											Like, what if you could
build Google in a day?
											What if you could sit over beer
and invent the next Snapchat,
											whatever it is,
											and tomorrow morning it&#39;s up and running?

									<p>
											And that is not science fiction.
											What&#39;s going to happen is,
											we are already in history.
											We&#39;ve unleashed this amazing creativity
											by de-slaving us from farming
											and later, of course, from factory work
											and have invented so many things.
											It&#39;s going to be even better,
in my opinion.
											And there&#39;s going to be
great side effects.
											One of the side effects will be
											that things like food and medical supply
and education and shelter
											and transportation
											will all become much more
affordable to all of us,
											not just the rich people.

											CA: Hmm.
											So when Martin Ford argued, you know,
that this time it&#39;s different
											because the intelligence
that we&#39;ve used in the past
											to find new ways to be
											will be matched at the same pace
											by computers taking over those things,
											what I hear you saying
is that, not completely,
											because of human creativity.
											Do you think that that&#39;s fundamentally
different from the kind of creativity

											ST: So, that&#39;s my firm
belief as an AI person —
											that I haven&#39;t seen
any real progress on creativity
											and out-of-the-box thinking.
											What I see right now — and this is
really important for people to realize,
											because the word &quot;artificial
intelligence&quot; is so threatening,
											and then we have Steve Spielberg
tossing a movie in,
											where all of a sudden
the computer is our overlord,
											but it&#39;s really a technology.
											It&#39;s a technology that helps us
do repetitive things.
											And the progress has been
entirely on the repetitive end.
											It&#39;s been in legal document discovery.
											It&#39;s been contract drafting.
											It&#39;s been screening X-rays of your chest.
											And these things are so specialized,
											I don&#39;t see the big threat of humanity.
											In fact, we as people —
											I mean, let&#39;s face it:
we&#39;ve become superhuman.
											We&#39;ve made us superhuman.
											We can swim across
the Atlantic in 11 hours.
											We can take a device out of our pocket
											and shout all the way to Australia,
											and in real time, have that person
shouting back to us.
											That&#39;s physically not possible.
We&#39;re breaking the rules of physics.
											When this is said and done,
we&#39;re going to remember everything
											we&#39;ve ever said and seen,
											you&#39;ll remember every person,
											which is good for me
in my early stages of Alzheimer&#39;s.
											Sorry, what was I saying? I forgot.

											ST: And think about this:
											if you look at the history of humanity,
											that might be whatever —
60-100,000 years old, give or take —
											almost everything that you cherish
in terms of invention,
											of technology, of things we&#39;ve built,
											has been invented in the last 150 years.
											If you toss in the book and the wheel,
it&#39;s a little bit older.

											these chairs, modern
manufacturing, penicillin —
											the things we cherish.

has gone up, not gone down, in my opinion.

things have been invented yet. Right?
											We haven&#39;t cured cancer.
											We don&#39;t have flying cars — yet.

people laughed about. (Laughs)

											We don&#39;t live twice as long yet. OK?

implant in our brain

He spent his early years in India, Pakistan and Afghanistan, where his parents worked as medical missionaries, and he attended an American school in the Himalayas for his early education. After boarding school in Bath, England, he went on to Oxford University, graduating in 1978 with a degree in philosophy, politics and economics.</p><p class=\"p1\">Chris then trained as a journalist, working in newspapers and radio, including two years producing a world news service in the Seychelles Islands.</p><p class=\"p1\"> Back in the UK in 1984, Chris was captivated by the personal computer revolution and became an editor at one of the UK&#39;s early computer magazines. A year later he founded Future Publishing with a $25,000 bank loan. The new company initially focused on specialist computer publications but eventually expanded into other areas such as cycling, music, video games, technology and design, doubling in size every year for seven years. In 1994, Chris moved to the United States where he built Imagine Media, publisher of <em>Business 2.0</em> magazine and creator of the popular video game users website IGN. Chris eventually merged Imagine and Future, taking the combined entity public in London in 1999, under the Future name. At its peak, it published 150 magazines and websites and employed 2,000 people.</p><p class=\"p1\">This success allowed Chris to create a private nonprofit organization, the Sapling Foundation, with the hope of finding new ways to tackle tough global issues through media, technology, entrepreneurship and, most of all, ideas. In 2001, the foundation acquired the TED Conference, then an annual meeting of luminaries in the fields of Technology, Entertainment and Design held in Monterey, California, and Chris left Future to work full time on TED.</p><p class=\"p1\">He expanded the conference&#39;s remit to cover all topics, including science, business and key global issues, while adding a Fellows program, which now has some 300 alumni, and the TED Prize, which grants its recipients &quot;one wish to change the world.&quot; The TED stage has become a place for thinkers and doers from all fields to share their ideas and their work, capturing imaginations, sparking conversation and encouraging discovery along the way.</p><p class=\"p1\">In 2006, TED experimented with posting some of its talks on the Internet. Their viral success encouraged Chris to begin positioning the organization as a global media initiative devoted to &#39;ideas worth spreading,&#39; part of a new era of information dissemination using the power of online video. In June 2015, the organization posted its 2,000th talk online. The talks are free to view, and they have been translated into more than 100 languages with the help of volunteers from around the world. Viewership has grown to approximately one billion views per year.</p><p class=\"p1\">Continuing a strategy of &#39;radical openness,&#39; in 2009 Chris introduced the TEDx initiative, allowing free licenses to local organizers who wished to organize their own TED-like events. More than 8,000 such events have been held, generating an archive of 60,000 TEDx talks. And three years later, the TED-Ed program was launched, offering free educational videos and tools to students and teachers.</p>"}],"url":"https://www.ted.com/talks/sebastian_thrun_and_chris_anderson_the_new_generation_of_computers_is_programming_itself","viewed_count":1549393,"talks":[{"recommendations":{"status":"approved","headline":"Sebsatian Thrun recommends","blurb":"Further reading curated by Sebastian Thrun","start_at":null,"end_at":null,"published":true,"eyebrow":"","type":"recommendation","rec_lists":[{"title":"","description":"","rec_items":[{"label":"READ_Book","headline":"*Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach* (3rd Edition)","blurb":"","note":"Stuart Russell, Peter Norvig\r\nPearson, 2009","link_url":"https://www.amazon.com/Artificial-Intelligence-Modern-Approach-3rd/dp/0136042597/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0520271440&linkCode=as2&tag=teco06-20","position":null,"is_pdf":false,"eyebrow":""},{"label":"READ_Book","headline":"*Deep Learning* (Adaptive Computation and Machine Learning series)","blurb":"","note":"Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, Aaron Courville\r\nThe MIT Press, 2016","link_url":"https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Learning-Adaptive-Computation-Machine/dp/0262035618/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0520271440&linkCode=as2&tag=teco06-20","position":null,"is_pdf":false,"eyebrow":""},{"label":"EXPLORE","headline":"Deep Learning nanodegree","blurb":"","note":"Udacity","link_url":"https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree-foundation--nd101","position":null,"is_pdf":false,"eyebrow":""},{"label":"EXPLORE","headline":"Intro to Self-Driving Cars","blurb":"","note":"Udacity","link_url":"https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-self-driving-cars--nd113","position":null,"is_pdf":false,"eyebrow":""}]}]},"more_resources":[],"corrections":[],"has_citations":false,"take_action":[],"explore_cta_experiment":{},"curator_approved":true,"description":"Educator and entrepreneur Sebastian Thrun wants us to use AI to free humanity of repetitive work and unleash our creativity.

He spent his early years in India, Pakistan and Afghanistan, where his parents worked as medical missionaries, and he attended an American school in the Himalayas for his early education. After boarding school in Bath, England, he went on to Oxford University, graduating in 1978 with a degree in philosophy, politics and economics.</p><p class=\"p1\">Chris then trained as a journalist, working in newspapers and radio, including two years producing a world news service in the Seychelles Islands.</p><p class=\"p1\"> Back in the UK in 1984, Chris was captivated by the personal computer revolution and became an editor at one of the UK&#39;s early computer magazines. A year later he founded Future Publishing with a $25,000 bank loan. The new company initially focused on specialist computer publications but eventually expanded into other areas such as cycling, music, video games, technology and design, doubling in size every year for seven years. In 1994, Chris moved to the United States where he built Imagine Media, publisher of <em>Business 2.0</em> magazine and creator of the popular video game users website IGN. Chris eventually merged Imagine and Future, taking the combined entity public in London in 1999, under the Future name. At its peak, it published 150 magazines and websites and employed 2,000 people.</p><p class=\"p1\">This success allowed Chris to create a private nonprofit organization, the Sapling Foundation, with the hope of finding new ways to tackle tough global issues through media, technology, entrepreneurship and, most of all, ideas. In 2001, the foundation acquired the TED Conference, then an annual meeting of luminaries in the fields of Technology, Entertainment and Design held in Monterey, California, and Chris left Future to work full time on TED.</p><p class=\"p1\">He expanded the conference&#39;s remit to cover all topics, including science, business and key global issues, while adding a Fellows program, which now has some 300 alumni, and the TED Prize, which grants its recipients &quot;one wish to change the world.&quot; The TED stage has become a place for thinkers and doers from all fields to share their ideas and their work, capturing imaginations, sparking conversation and encouraging discovery along the way.</p><p class=\"p1\">In 2006, TED experimented with posting some of its talks on the Internet. Their viral success encouraged Chris to begin positioning the organization as a global media initiative devoted to &#39;ideas worth spreading,&#39; part of a new era of information dissemination using the power of online video. In June 2015, the organization posted its 2,000th talk online. The talks are free to view, and they have been translated into more than 100 languages with the help of volunteers from around the world. Viewership has grown to approximately one billion views per year.</p><p class=\"p1\">Continuing a strategy of &#39;radical openness,&#39; in 2009 Chris introduced the TEDx initiative, allowing free licenses to local organizers who wished to organize their own TED-like events. More than 8,000 such events have been held, generating an archive of 60,000 TEDx talks. And three years later, the TED-Ed program was launched, offering free educational videos and tools to students and teachers.</p>"}],"speaker_name":"Sebastian Thrun and Chris Anderson","tags":["AI","cancer","algorithm","computers","creativity","collaboration","driverless cars","data","future","entrepreneur","innovation","interview","invention","intelligence","motivation","society","potential","software","technology","work"],"title":"What AI is -- and isn't","video_type":{"id":"1","name":"TED Stage Talk"},"viewed_count":1549393}]}})</script></div>
