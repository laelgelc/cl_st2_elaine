											Namaste. Good morning.
											I&#39;m very happy to be here in India.
											And I&#39;ve been thinking a lot about what I have learned
											over these last particularly 11 years
											with V-Day and &quot;The Vagina Monologues,&quot;
											traveling the world,
											essentially meeting with women and girls across the planet

											What I want to talk about today
											is this particular cell,
											or grouping of cells, that is in each and every one of us.
											And I want to call it the girl cell.
											And it&#39;s in men as well as in women.
											I want you to imagine that this particular grouping of cells
											is central to the evolution of our species
											and the continuation of the human race.

											And I want you imagine that at some point in history
											a group of powerful people invested in owning and controlling the world
											understood that the suppression of this particular cell,
											the oppression of these cells,
											the reinterpretation of these cells,
											the undermining of these cells,
											getting us to believe in the weakness of these cells
											and the crushing, eradicating, destroying,
											reducing these cells,
											basically began the process of killing off the girl cell,

											I want you to imagine that the girl is a chip
											in the huge macrocosm of collective consciousness.
											And it is essential to balance, to wisdom
											and to actually the future of all of us.
											And then I want you to imagine that this girl cell
											is compassion,
											and it&#39;s empathy, and it&#39;s passion itself,
											and it&#39;s vulnerability,
											and it&#39;s openness, and it&#39;s intensity,

									<p>
											And then let&#39;s think how compassion informs wisdom,
											and that vulnerability is our greatest strength,
											and that emotions have inherent logic,
											which lead to radical, appropriate, saving action.
											And then let&#39;s remember that we&#39;ve been taught
											the exact opposite by the powers that be,
											that compassion clouds your thinking,
											that it gets in the way,
											that vulnerability is weakness,
											that emotions are not to be trusted,
											and you&#39;re not supposed to take things personally,
											which is one of my favorites.

											I think the whole world has essentially
											been brought up not to be a girl.
											How do we bring up boys? What does it mean to be a boy?
											To be a boy really means not to be a girl.
											To be a man means not to be a girl.
											To be a woman means not to be a girl.
											To be strong means not to be a girl.
											To be a leader means not to be a girl.

											And I&#39;d also like to say that the irony

											the most extreme forms of violence,
											the most horrific poverty,

											really was the turning point in my soul.
											I went and I spent time
											in a place called Bukavu
											in a hospital called the Panzi Hospital,
											with a doctor who was as close to a saint as any person I&#39;ve ever met.
											His name is Dr. Denis Mukwege.
											In the Congo, for those of you who don&#39;t know,
											there has been a war raging for the last 12 years,
											a war that has killed nearly six million people.
											It is estimated that somewhere between 300,000 and 500,000 women

											When I spent my first weeks at Panzi hospital
											I sat with women

											Their stories were so horrific,
											and so mind-blowing and so on the other side of human existence,
											that to be perfectly honest with you, I was shattered.
											And I will tell you that what happened
											is through that shattering,
											listening to the stories of eight-year-old girls who had their insides eviscerated,
											who had guns and bayonets and things shoved inside them
											so they had holes, literally, inside them
											where their pee and poop came out of them.

											know that empire-building
											is actually — that feelings get in the way of empire-building.
											Feelings get in the way of the mass acquisition of the Earth,
											and excavating the Earth, and destroying things.
											I remember, for example, when my father,
											who was very, very violent, used to beat me.
											And he would actually say, while he was beating me,
											&quot;Don&#39;t you cry. Don&#39;t you dare cry.&quot;
											Because my crying somehow exposed his brutality to him.
											And even in the moment he didn&#39;t want to be reminded

											And I think in some ways
											we&#39;ve been much harsher to men
											in the annihilation of their girl cell.
											(Applause)
											I see how boys have been brought up, and I see this across the planet:
											to be tough, to be hardened,
											to distance themselves from their tenderness, to not cry.
											I actually realized once in Kosovo,
											when I watched a man break down,
											that bullets are actually hardened tears,
											that when we don&#39;t allow men to have their girl self
											and have their vulnerability, and have their compassion,
											and have their hearts, that they become hardened and hurtful

											And I will tell you a very funny story.
											On my way here on the airplane, I was walking up and down the aisle of the plane.
											And all these men, literally at least 10 men,
											were in their little seats watching chick flicks.

											The state of girls, the condition of girls,

											Then, her time was ready
											when she had to go back to talk to her father
											about the reconciliation, after a year.
											I had the privilege of being in the hut
											when she was reunited with her father and reconciled.
											In that hut, we walked in,
											and her father and his four wives were sitting there,
											and her sisters who had just returned because
											they had all fled when she had fled,
											and her primary mother, who had been beaten
											in standing up for her with the elders.
											When her father saw her and saw who she had become,
											in her full girl self,
											he threw his arms around her and broke down crying.
											He said, &quot;You are beautiful. You have grown into a gorgeous woman.
											We will not cut you.
											And I give you my word, here and now,
											that we will not cut your sisters either.&quot;

											This is called &quot;I&#39;m An Emotional Creature.&quot;
											And it happened because I met a girl in Watts, L.A.
											I was asking girls if they like being a girl,

Monologues</a></em>. The play recounts <strong>tender, funny, gripping and horrifying stories she gathered from hundreds of women</strong> about their bodies, their sexual experiences, and yes, their vaginas. Since its first staging in 1996, it has been translated into more than 45 languages, performed in more than 120 countries and re-created as an HBO film. <br /><br /><em>The Vagina Monologues</em>&#39; success allowed Ensler to create <strong><a href=\"http://www.vday.org/main.html\" target=\"_blank\">V-Day</a></strong>, <strong>a global activist movement to end violence against women and girls, which has so far raised $85 million</strong> to prevent violence and protect abused women. In February 2011, Ensler received the Isabelle Stephenson Tony Award for her philanthropic work. Ensler has also drawn praise for <em><a href=\"http://www.thegoodbody.com/\" target=\"_blank\">The Good Body</a>,</em> a play that cuts to women&#39;s obsession with their appearance, and her film <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/pov/whatiwant/\"><em>What I Want My Words to Do to You</em></a>, which portrays a writing group she leads at a correctional facility for women. Today, she continues to find new projects and push the envelope. Her latest play, <a href=\"http://geni.us/emotionalcreature\" target=\"_blank\"><em>I Am an Emotional Creature: The Secret Life of Girls Around the World</em></a>, hit the <em>New York Times</em> bestseller list and just wrapped a workshop production in Johannesburg -- nest stop is Paris and then Berkeley in June 2012.</p>"}],"speaker_name":"Eve Ensler","tags":["culture","feminism","gender","self","social change","women"],"title":"Embrace your inner girl","video_type":{"id":"1","name":"TED Stage Talk"},"viewed_count":1439245}]}})</script></div>
