											This is TED; this is
Technology, Entertainment, Design,
											and there&#39;s a dairy cow.
											It&#39;s a quite wonderfully designed animal.
											And I was thinking,
how do I introduce this?
											And I thought, well, maybe
that old doggerel by Joyce Kilmer,
											you know: &quot;Poems are made by fools
like me, but only God can make a tree.&quot;
											And you might say,
&quot;Well, God designed the cow.&quot;

											But, of course, God got a lot of help.
											This is the ancestor of cattle.
											This is the aurochs.
											And it was designed by natural selection,
											the process of natural selection,
over many millions of years.
											And then it became domesticated,
thousands of years ago.
											And human beings became its stewards,
											and, without even knowing
what they were doing,
											they gradually redesigned it
and redesigned it and redesigned it.
											And then more recently, they really began
to do reverse engineering on this beast
											and figure out just what
the parts were, how they worked
											and how they might be optimized —
how they might be made better.

											Now, why am I talking about cows?
											Because I want to say that
much the same thing is true of religions.
											Religions are natural phenomena —
they&#39;re just as natural as cows.
											They have evolved over millennia.
											They have a biological base,
just like the aurochs.
											They have become domesticated,
											and human beings have been redesigning
their religions for thousands of years.
											This is TED, and I want
to talk about design.
											Because what I&#39;ve been doing
for the last four years —
											really since the first time you saw me —
											some of you saw me at TED
when I was talking about religion —
											and in the last four years,
											I&#39;ve been working
just about non-stop on this topic.
											And you might say it&#39;s about
the reverse engineering of religions.
											Now that very idea, I think,
strikes terror in many people,
											or anger, or anxiety
of one sort or another.
											And that is the spell
that I want to break.

											I want to say, no, religions
are an important natural phenomenon.
											We should study them
with the same intensity
											that we study all the other
important natural phenomena,
											like global warming, as we heard
so eloquently last night from Al Gore.
											Today&#39;s religions are brilliantly
designed — brilliantly designed.
											They are immensely powerful
social institutions
											and many of their features
can be traced back to earlier features
											that we can really make sense of
by reverse engineering.
											And, as with the cow, there&#39;s a mixture
of evolutionary design —
											designed by natural selection itself —
											and intelligent design —
											more or less intelligent design —
											and redesigned by human beings
											who are trying
to redesign their religions.

											You don&#39;t do book talks at TED,
											but I&#39;m going to have
just one slide about my book,
											because there is one message in it
											which I think this group
really needs to hear.
											And I would be very interested
to get your responses to this.
											It&#39;s the one policy proposal
that I make in the book,
											at this time, when I claim
not to know enough about religion
											to know what other
policy proposals to make.

											Here&#39;s my proposal,
											I&#39;m going to just take a couple
of minutes to explain it:
											Education on world religions
for all of our children —
											in primary school, in high school,
											in public schools, in private schools
and in home schooling.
											So what I&#39;m proposing is,
											just as we require reading, writing,
arithmetic, American history,
											so we should have a curriculum on facts
about all the religions of the world —
											about their history,
about their creeds, about their texts,
											their music, their symbolisms,
their prohibitions, their requirements.
											And this should be presented
factually, straightforwardly,
											with no particular spin,
to all of the children in the country.
											And as long as you teach them that,
											you can teach them anything else you like.
											That, I think, is maximal tolerance
for religious freedom.
											As long as you inform your children
about other religions,
											then you may — and as early as you like
and whatever you like —
											teach them whatever creed
you want them to learn.
											But also let them know
about other religions.

									<p>
											Now, why do I say that?
											Because democracy depends
on an informed citizenship.
											Informed consent is the very bedrock
of our understanding of democracy.
											Misinformed consent is not worth it.
											It&#39;s like a coin flip;
it doesn&#39;t count, really.
											Democracy depends on informed consent.
											This is the way we treat people
as responsible adults.
											Now, children below the age of consent
are a special case.
											Parents — I&#39;m going to use a word
that Pastor Rick just used —
											parents are stewards of their children.
											They don&#39;t own them.
											You can&#39;t own your children.
											You have a responsibility to the world,
											to the state, to them,
to take care of them right.
											You may teach them whatever creed
you think is most important,
											but I say you have a responsibility
to let them be informed
											about all the other creeds
in the world, too.

											The reason I&#39;ve taken this time
is I&#39;ve been fascinated to hear
											some of the reactions to this.
											One reviewer for a Roman Catholic
newspaper called it &quot;totalitarian.&quot;
											It strikes me as practically libertarian.
											Is it totalitarian to require
reading, writing and arithmetic?
											I don&#39;t think so.
											All I&#39;m saying is —
											and facts, facts only;
no values, just facts —
											about all the world&#39;s religions.
											Another reviewer called it &quot;hilarious.&quot;
											Well, I&#39;m really bothered by the fact
											that anybody would think
that was hilarious.
											It seems to me to be such a plausible,
											natural extension of the democratic
principles we already have
											that I&#39;m shocked to think anybody
would find that just ridiculous.
											I know many religions
											are so anxious about preserving the purity
of their faith among their children
											that they are intent on keeping
their children ignorant of other faiths.
											I don&#39;t think that&#39;s defensible.
											But I&#39;d really be pleased
to get your answers on that —
											any reactions to that — later.

											Back to the cow.
											This picture, which I pulled
off the web —
											the fellow on the left is really
an important part of this picture.
											That&#39;s the steward.
											Cows couldn&#39;t live without human
stewards — they&#39;re domesticated.
											They&#39;re a sort of ectosymbiont.
											They depend on us for their survival.
											And Pastor Rick
was just talking about sheep.
											I&#39;m going to talk about sheep, too.
											There&#39;s a lot of serendipitous

by the process of natural selection

with the brilliance of what&#39;s discovered.

											When I was here four years ago,

to get into the belly of a sheep or a cow

											Now, I talked to Paul afterwards —
I wanted to check to find out
											how he&#39;d calculated this, and get
the sources and so forth —
											and he also gave me a paper
that he had written on this.
											And there was a passage in it
which he did not present here
											and I think it is so good,
I&#39;m going to read it to you:
											&quot;Over billions of years
on a unique sphere,
											chance has painted
a thin covering of life:
											complex, improbable,
wonderful and fragile.
											Suddenly, we humans —
a recently arrived species
											no longer subject to the checks
and balances inherent in nature —
											have grown in population,
technology and intelligence
											to a position of terrible power.
											We now wield the paintbrush.&quot;
											We heard about the atmosphere
as a thin layer of varnish.
											Life itself is just a thin coat
of paint on this planet.
											And we&#39;re the ones
that hold the paintbrush.
											And how can we do that?

											It&#39;s a brilliant redesign
of traditional religious themes —
											updating them, quietly dropping
obsolete features,
											putting new interpretations
on other features.
											This is the evolution of religion that&#39;s
been going on for thousands of years,
											and he&#39;s just the latest
brilliant practitioner of it.
											I don&#39;t have to tell you this;
you just heard the man.
											Excellent insights into human psychology,
wise advice on every page.
											Moreover, he invites us
to look under the hood.
											I really appreciated that.
											For instance, he has an appendix
where he explains
											his choice of translations
of different Bible verses.
											The book is clear, vivid, accessible,
beautifully formatted.
											Just enough repetition.
											That&#39;s really important.
											Every time you read it or say it,
you make another copy in your brain.

											My problem is, some of the bits in it
I don&#39;t think are true.
											Now some of this
is a difference of opinion.
											And that&#39;s not my main complaint,
that&#39;s worth mentioning.
											Here&#39;s a passage — it&#39;s very much
what he said, anyway:
											&quot;If there was no God
we would all be accidents,
											the result of astronomical
random chance in the Universe.
											You could stop reading this book
because life would have no purpose
											or meaning or significance.
											There would be no right or wrong
											and no hope beyond
your brief years on Earth.&quot;
											Now, I just do not believe that.
											By the way, I find — Homer Groening&#39;s
film presented a beautiful alternative
											to that very claim.
											Yes, there is meaning and a reason
for right or wrong.
											We don&#39;t need a belief in God
to be good or to have meaning in us.
											But that, as I said,
is just a difference of opinion.
											That&#39;s not what I&#39;m really worried about.

											How about this: &quot;God designed
this planet&#39;s environment
											just so we could live in it.&quot;
											I&#39;m afraid that a lot of people
take that sentiment to mean
											that we don&#39;t have to do
the sorts of things
											that Al Gore is trying so hard
to get us to do.
											I am not happy with that sentiment at all.
											And then I find this: &quot;All the evidence
available in the biological sciences
											supports the core proposition that
the cosmos is a specially designed whole
											with life and mankind
as its fundamental goal and purpose,
											a whole in which all facets
of reality have their meaning
											and explanation in this central fact.&quot;
											Well, that&#39;s Michael Denton.
He&#39;s a creationist.
											And here, I think, &quot;Wait a minute.&quot;
I read this again.
											I read it three or four times and I think,
											&quot;Is he really endorsing
Intelligent Design?
											Is he endorsing creationism here?&quot;
											And you can&#39;t tell.
											So I&#39;m sort of thinking,

											But then I read on, and I read this:
&quot;First, Noah had never seen rain,
											because prior to the Flood, God irrigated
the earth from the ground up.&quot;
											I wish that sentence weren&#39;t in there,
because I think it is false.
											And I think that thinking this way
about the history of the planet,
											after we&#39;ve just been hearing
about the history of the planet

											Here&#39;s one: &quot;God deliberately shaped
and formed you to serve him
											in a way that makes your ministry unique.
											He carefully mixed the DNA cocktail
that created you.&quot;
											I think that&#39;s false.
											Now, maybe we want to treat it
as metaphorical.
											Here&#39;s another one: &quot;For instance,
your brain can store 100 trillion facts.
											Your mind can handle
15,000 decisions a second.&quot;
											Well, it would be interesting
to find the interpretation
											where I would accept that.
											There might be some way
of treating that as true.
											&quot;Anthropologists have noted
that worship is a universal urge,
											hardwired by God into
the very fiber of our being —
											an inbuilt need to connect with God.&quot;

											And what I find
deeply troubling in this book
											is that he seems to be arguing
that if you want to be moral,
											if you want to have meaning in your life,
											you have to be an Intelligent Designer,
											you have to deny the theory of evolution
by natural selection.
											And I think, on the contrary,
											that it is very important
to solving the world&#39;s problems
											that we take evolutionary
biology seriously.
											Whose truth are we going to listen to?
											Well, this is from
&quot;The Purpose Driven Life&quot;:
											&quot;The Bible must become
the authoritative standard for my life:
											the compass I rely on for direction,
											the counsel I listen to
for making wise decisions,
											and the benchmark I use

											I&#39;ve got one more problem,

a response if Rick is able to do it.
											&quot;In the Great Commission, Jesus said,

and make them my disciples.
											Baptize them in the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Spirit,
											and teach them to do

of the world in the last day or so.
											Here&#39;s one, not as beautiful
as the others;
											it simply shows
the religions of the world.
											Here&#39;s one that shows the sort of current

He argues that the brain&#39;s computational circuitry fools us into thinking we know more than we do, and that what we call consciousness &mdash; isn&#39;t. His 2003 book &quot;Freedom Evolves&quot; explores how our brains evolved to give  us -- and only us -- the kind of freedom that matters, while 2006&#39;s  &quot;Breaking the Spell&quot; examines belief through the lens of biology.<br /><br />This mind-shifting perspective on the mind itself has distinguished Dennett&#39;s career as a philosopher and cognitive scientist. And while the philosophy community has never quite known what to make of Dennett (he defies easy categorization, and refuses to affiliate himself with accepted schools of thought), his computational approach to understanding the brain has made him, as Edge&#39;s John Brockman writes, &ldquo;the philosopher of choice of the AI community.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;It&#39;s tempting to say that Dennett has never met a robot he didn&#39;t like, and that what he likes most about them is that they are philosophical experiments,&rdquo; Harry Blume wrote in the <em>Atlantic Monthly</em> in 1998. &ldquo;To the question of whether machines can attain high-order intelligence, Dennett makes this provocative answer: &lsquo;The best reason for believing that robots might some day become conscious is that we human beings are conscious, and we are a sort of robot ourselves.&#39;&quot;</p><p>In recent years, Dennett has become outspoken in his atheism, and his 2006 book&nbsp;<a href=\"http://geni.us/breakingthespell\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Breaking the Spell</em></a>&nbsp;calls for religion to be studied through the scientific lens of evolutionary biology. Dennett regards religion as a natural -- rather than supernatural -- phenomenon, and urges schools to break the taboo against empirical examination of religion. He argues that religion&#39;s influence over human behavior is precisely what makes gaining a rational understanding of it so necessary: &ldquo;If we don&#39;t understand religion, we&#39;re going to miss our chance to improve the world in the 21st century.&rdquo;</p><p>Dennett&#39;s landmark books include <em>The Mind&#39;s I</em>, co-edited with Douglas Hofstaedter,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://geni.us/consciousnessexplained\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Consciousness Explained</em></a><em>,</em> and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://geni.us/darwinsdangerousidea\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Darwin&#39;s Dangerous Idea</em></a><em>. </em>Read an excerpt from his 2013 book, <a href=\"http://geni.us/intuitionpumps\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Intuition Pumps</em></a>, in the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2013/may/19/daniel-dennett-intuition-pumps-thinking-extract\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Guardian</em> &gt;&gt;</a>  </p>"}],"url":"https://www.ted.com/talks/dan_dennett_s_response_to_rick_warren","viewed_count":3589632,"talks":[{"explore_cta_experiment":{},"curator_approved":true,"description":"Philosopher Dan Dennett calls for religion -- all religion -- to be taught in schools, so we can understand its nature as a natural phenomenon.

He is the next Bertrand Russell. Unlike traditional philosophers, Dan is a student of neuroscience, linguistics, artificial intelligence, computer science, and psychology. He's redefining and reforming the role of the philosopher.","whotheyare":"Dan Dennett thinks that human consciousness and free will are the result of physical processes.","whylisten":"<p>One of our most important living philosophers, Dan Dennett is best known for his provocative and controversial arguments that human consciousness and free will are the result of physical processes in the brain. He argues that the brain&#39;s computational circuitry fools us into thinking we know more than we do, and that what we call consciousness &mdash; isn&#39;t. His 2003 book &quot;Freedom Evolves&quot; explores how our brains evolved to give  us -- and only us -- the kind of freedom that matters, while 2006&#39;s  &quot;Breaking the Spell&quot; examines belief through the lens of biology.<br /><br />This mind-shifting perspective on the mind itself has distinguished Dennett&#39;s career as a philosopher and cognitive scientist. And while the philosophy community has never quite known what to make of Dennett (he defies easy categorization, and refuses to affiliate himself with accepted schools of thought), his computational approach to understanding the brain has made him, as Edge&#39;s John Brockman writes, &ldquo;the philosopher of choice of the AI community.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;It&#39;s tempting to say that Dennett has never met a robot he didn&#39;t like, and that what he likes most about them is that they are philosophical experiments,&rdquo; Harry Blume wrote in the <em>Atlantic Monthly</em> in 1998. &ldquo;To the question of whether machines can attain high-order intelligence, Dennett makes this provocative answer: &lsquo;The best reason for believing that robots might some day become conscious is that we human beings are conscious, and we are a sort of robot ourselves.&#39;&quot;</p><p>In recent years, Dennett has become outspoken in his atheism, and his 2006 book&nbsp;<a href=\"http://geni.us/breakingthespell\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Breaking the Spell</em></a>&nbsp;calls for religion to be studied through the scientific lens of evolutionary biology. Dennett regards religion as a natural -- rather than supernatural -- phenomenon, and urges schools to break the taboo against empirical examination of religion. He argues that religion&#39;s influence over human behavior is precisely what makes gaining a rational understanding of it so necessary: &ldquo;If we don&#39;t understand religion, we&#39;re going to miss our chance to improve the world in the 21st century.&rdquo;</p><p>Dennett&#39;s landmark books include <em>The Mind&#39;s I</em>, co-edited with Douglas Hofstaedter,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://geni.us/consciousnessexplained\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Consciousness Explained</em></a><em>,</em> and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://geni.us/darwinsdangerousidea\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Darwin&#39;s Dangerous Idea</em></a><em>. </em>Read an excerpt from his 2013 book, <a href=\"http://geni.us/intuitionpumps\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Intuition Pumps</em></a>, in the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2013/may/19/daniel-dennett-intuition-pumps-thinking-extract\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Guardian</em> &gt;&gt;</a>  </p>"}],"speaker_name":"Dan Dennett","tags":["God","atheism","brain","cognitive science","consciousness","evolution","philosophy","religion"],"title":"Let's teach religion -- all religion -- in schools","video_type":{"id":"1","name":"TED Stage Talk"},"viewed_count":3589632}]}})</script></div>
