<title>Thordis Elva and Tom Stranger: Our story of rape and reconciliation | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: In 1996, Thordis Elva shared a teenage romance with Tom Stranger, an exchange student from Australia. After a school dance, Tom raped Thordis, after which they parted ways for many years. In this extraordinary talk, Elva and Stranger move through a years-long chronology of shame and silence, and invite us to discuss the omnipresent global issue of sexual violence in a new, honest way.

<meta content='In 1996, Thordis Elva shared a teenage romance with Tom Stranger, an exchange student from Australia. After a school dance, Tom raped Thordis, after which they parted ways for many years. In this extraordinary talk, Elva and Stranger move through a years-long chronology of shame and silence, and invite us to discuss the omnipresent global issue of sexual violence in a new, honest way.

											Tom Stranger: In 1996,
when I was 18 years old,
											I had the golden opportunity to go
on an international exchange program.
											Ironically I&#39;m an Australian
who prefers proper icy cold weather,
											so I was both excited and tearful
when I got on a plane to Iceland,
											after just having farewelled
my parents and brothers goodbye.
											I was welcomed into the home
of a beautiful Icelandic family
											who took me hiking,
											and helped me get a grasp
of the melodic Icelandic language.
											I struggled a bit with the initial
period of homesickness.
											I snowboarded after school,
											and I slept a lot.
											Two hours of chemistry class in a language
that you don&#39;t yet fully understand
											can be a pretty good sedative.

											My teacher recommended
I try out for the school play,

											It turns out I didn&#39;t end up
being part of the play,

											We shared a lovely teenage romance,
											and we&#39;d meet at lunchtimes
to just hold hands
											and walk around old downtown Reykjavík.
											I met her welcoming family,
and she met my friends.
											We&#39;d been in a budding relationship

											Thordis Elva: I was 16
and in love for the first time.
											Going together to the Christmas dance
											was a public confirmation
of our relationship,

girl in the world.
											No longer a child, but a young woman.
											High on my newfound maturity,
											I felt it was only natural to try drinking
rum for the first time that night, too.
											That was a bad idea.
											I became very ill,
											drifting in and out of consciousness
											in between spasms of convulsive vomiting.
											The security guards wanted
to call me an ambulance,
											but Tom acted as my knight
in shining armor,
											and told them he&#39;d take me home.

											his strong arms around me,

											But the gratitude that I felt
towards him soon turned to horror
											as he proceeded to take off my clothes
and get on top of me.
											My head had cleared up,
											but my body was still
too weak to fight back,
											and the pain was blinding.
											I thought I&#39;d be severed in two.
											In order to stay sane,

on my alarm clock.

											Despite limping for days
and crying for weeks,

about rape like I&#39;d seen on TV.
											Tom wasn&#39;t an armed lunatic;
											he was my boyfriend.

											By the time I could identify

											I was raised in a world
where girls are taught

											TS: I have vague memories of the next day:
											the after effects of drinking,
											a certain hollowness
that I tried to stifle.
											Nothing more.
											But I didn&#39;t show up at Thordis&#39;s door.
											It is important to now state
											that I didn&#39;t see my deed for what it was.
											The word &quot;rape&quot; didn&#39;t echo
around my mind as it should&#39;ve,
											and I wasn&#39;t crucifying myself
with memories of the night before.
											It wasn&#39;t so much a conscious refusal,
											it was more like any acknowledgment
of reality was forbidden.
											My definition of my actions completely
refuted any recognition
											of the immense trauma I caused Thordis.
											To be honest,
											I repudiated the entire act
in the days afterwards
											and when I was committing it.
											I disavowed the truth by convincing
myself it was sex and not rape.
											And this is a lie I&#39;ve felt

											One day, I stormed out
of the door in tears
											after a fight with a loved one,

											where I asked the waitress for a pen.
											I always had a notebook with me,
											claiming that it was to jot down ideas
in moments of inspiration,
											but the truth was that I needed
to be constantly fidgeting,
											because in moments of stillness,
											I found myself counting seconds again.
											But that day, I watched in wonder
as the words streamed out of my pen,
											forming the most pivotal letter
I&#39;ve ever written,
											addressed to Tom.
											Along with an account of the violence
that he subjected me to,
											the words, &quot;I want to find forgiveness&quot;
											stared back at me,
											surprising nobody more than myself.
											But deep down I realized that this
was my way out of my suffering,

he deserved my forgiveness,
											I deserved peace.

											Before sending the letter,

of negative responses,

no response whatsoever.
											The only outcome
that I didn&#39;t prepare myself for
											was the one that I then got —
											a typed confession from Tom,
full of disarming regret.
											As it turns out, he, too,
had been imprisoned by silence.
											And this marked the start
of an eight-year-long correspondence
											that God knows was never easy,
											but always honest.
											I relieved myself of the burdens
that I&#39;d wrongfully shouldered,
											and he, in turn, wholeheartedly
owned up to what he&#39;d done.
											Our written exchanges became a platform
											to dissect the consequences of that night,

											TS: Iceland and Australia
are geographically like this.
											In the middle of the two is South Africa.
											We decided upon the city of Cape Town,
											and there we met for one week.
											The city itself proved to be
a stunningly powerful environment
											to focus on reconciliation
and forgiveness.
											Nowhere else has healing
and rapprochement been tested
											like it has in South Africa.
											As a nation, South Africa sought
to sit within the truth of its past,

our own history.
											We followed a strict policy
of being honest,
											and this also came
with a certain exposure,

											There were gutting confessions,
											and moments where we just
absolutely couldn&#39;t fathom

											The seismic effects of sexual violence
were spoken aloud and felt,
											face to face.

											Don&#39;t underestimate the power of words.
											Saying to Thordis that I raped her
changed my accord with myself,
											as well as with her.
											But most importantly,
											the blame transferred from Thordis to me.
											Far too often,
											the responsibility is attributed
to female survivors of sexual violence,
											and not to the males who enact it.
											Far too often,
											the denial and running leaves all parties
at a great distance from the truth.
											There&#39;s definitely a public
conversation happening now,
											and like a lot of people,
											we&#39;re heartened
that there&#39;s less retreating
											from this difficult
but important discussion.
											I feel a real responsibility
to add our voices to it.

											TE: What we did is not a formula
that we&#39;re prescribing for others.
											Nobody has the right to tell anyone else
how to handle their deepest pain
											or their greatest error.
											Breaking your silence is never easy,
											and depending on where
you are in the world,
											it can even be deadly
to speak out about rape.
											I realize that even the most
traumatic event of my life
											is still a testament to my privilege,
											because I can talk about it
without getting ostracized,
											or even killed.
											But with that privilege of having a voice
											comes the responsibility of using it.
											That&#39;s the least I owe
my fellow survivors who can&#39;t.

											The story we&#39;ve just relayed is unique,
											and yet it is so common with sexual
violence being a global pandemic.
											But it doesn&#39;t have to be that way.
											One of the things that I found useful
on my own healing journey
											is educating myself about sexual violence.
											And as a result,
I&#39;ve been reading, writing
											and speaking about this issue
for over a decade now,
											going to conferences around the world.
											And in my experience,
											the attendees of such events
are almost exclusively women.
											But it&#39;s about time that we stop treating
sexual violence as a women&#39;s issue.

											A majority of sexual violence
against women and men
											is perpetrated by men.
											And yet their voices are sorely
underrepresented in this discussion.
											But all of us are needed here.
											Just imagine all the suffering
we could alleviate
											if we dared to face this issue together.
