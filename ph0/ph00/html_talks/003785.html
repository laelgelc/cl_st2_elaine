											I bring to you
											a message from
											tens of thousands of people —
											in the villages, in the slums,
											in the hinterland of the country —
											who have solved problems
											through their own genius,
											without any
											outside help.
											When our home minister announces
											a few weeks ago
											a war on
											one third of India,
											about 200 districts that he mentioned
											were ungovernable,
											he missed the point.
											The point that we have been stressing
											for the last 21 years,
											the point that
											people may be economically poor,
											but they&#39;re not poor in the mind.
											In other words,
											the minds on the margin
											are not the marginal minds.
											That is the message,
											which we started 31 years ago.
											And what did it start?

											Let me just tell you, briefly, my personal journey,
											which led me to come to this point.
											In &#39;85, &#39;86, I was in Bangladesh
											advising the government and the research council there
											how to help scientists work on the lands,
											on the fields of the poor people,
											and how to develop research technologies,
											which are based on the knowledge of the people.
											I came back in &#39;86.
											I had been tremendously invigorated
											by the knowledge and creativity that I found in that country,
											which had 60 percent landlessness
											but amazing creativity.
											I started looking at my own work:
											The work that I had done
											for the previous 10 years,
											almost every time,
											had instances of knowledge
											that people had shared.
									</p>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now, I was paid in dollars as a consultant,
											and I looked at my income tax return
											and tried to ask myself: &quot;Is there a line in my return,
											which shows how much of this income has gone
											to the people whose knowledge
											has made it possible?
											Was it because I&#39;m brilliant
											that I&#39;m getting this reward, or because of the revolution?
											Is it that I write very well?
											Is it that I articulate very well?
											Is it that I analyze the data very well?
											Is it because I&#39;m a professor, and, therefore,
											I must be entitled to this reward from society?&quot;
											I tried to convince myself that, &quot;No, no,
											I have worked for the policy changes.
											You know, the public policy will become
											more responsive to the needs of the poor,
											and, therefore I think it&#39;s okay.&quot;
											But it appeared to me
											that all these years that I&#39;d been working on exploitation —
											exploitation by landlords,
											by moneylenders, by traders —
											gave me an insight that
											probably I was also an exploiter,
											because there was no line in my income tax return
											which showed this income accrued
											because of the brilliance of the people —
											those people who have shared their knowledge and good faith and trust with me —
											and nothing ever went back to them.
											So much so, that much of my work till that time
											was in the English language.
									</p>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											The majority of the people from whom I learned didn&#39;t know English.
											So what kind of a contributor was I?
											I was talking about social justice,
											and here I was, a professional
											who was pursuing the most unjust act —
											of taking knowledge from the people, making them anonymous,
											getting rent from that knowledge
											by sharing it and doing consultancy, writing papers and
											publishing them in the papers,
											getting invited to the conferences,
											getting consultancies and whatever have you.
											So then, a dilemma rose in the mind that,
											if I&#39;m also an exploiter, then this is not right;
											life cannot go on like that.
											And this was a moment of great pain and trauma
											because I couldn&#39;t live with it any longer.
											So I did a review of
											ethical dilemma and value conflicts and management research,
											wrote, read about 100 papers.
											And I came to the conclusion that
											while dilemma is unique,
											dilemma is not unique; the solution had to be unique.

											And one day — I don&#39;t know what happened —
											while coming back from the office towards home,
											maybe I saw a honey bee
											or it occurred to my mind that if I only could be like the honey bee,
											life would be wonderful.
											What the honey bee does: it pollinates,
											takes nectar from the flower,
											pollinates another flower, cross-pollinates.
											And when it takes the nectar,
											the flowers don&#39;t feel shortchanged.
											In fact, they invite the honey bees
											through their colors,
											and the bees don&#39;t keep all the honey for themselves.
											These are the three guiding principles of the Honey Bee Network:
											that whenever we learn something from people
											it must be shared with them in their language.
											They must not remain anonymous.

											And I must tell you that after 20 years,
											I have not made one percent of change
											in the professional practice of this art.
											That is a great tragedy — which I&#39;m carrying still with me
											and I hope that all of you will carry this with you —
											that the profession still legitimizes publication
											of knowledge of people without attributing them
											by making them anonymous.
											The research guidelines of U.S. National Academy of Sciences
											or Research Councils of the U.K.
											or of Indian Councils of Science Research
											do not require
											that whatever you learn from people, you must share back with them.
											We are talking about an accountable society,
											a society that is fair and just,
											and we don&#39;t even do justice in the knowledge market.
											And India wants to be a knowledge society.
											How will it be a knowledge society?
											So, obviously, you cannot have two principles of justice,
											one for yourself and one for others.
											It must be the same.
											You cannot discriminate.
											You cannot be in favor of your own values,
											which are at a distance from
											the values that you espouse.
											So, fairness to one and to the other
											is not divisible.

											The rice that you ate in the lunch, and you will eat today,

											This is not what our parliament would do. You know,

											We saw it in Shodh Yatra. Every six months we walk

											I&#39;ve walked about 4,000 kilometers in the last 12 years.
											So on the wayside

											Now, this lady, on the wall of the dung cake heap,
											has made a painting.
											That&#39;s the only space she could express her creativity.

											Bhabi Mahato in Purulia and Bankura.

											Is she an artisan or an artist?
											Obviously she&#39;s an artist; she&#39;s a creative person.
											If we can create markets for these artists,

											In Motihari in Champaran,
											there are a lot of people who sell tea on the shack

											Every morning you have tea, as well as coffee.
											So he thought, why don&#39;t I convert

											So this is a coffee machine. Just takes a few hundred rupees.
											People bring their own cooker,

											So this fellow is bringing

											I think we need a polycentric model of development,
											where a large number of initiatives in different parts of the country,

											Higher the local fit,

									<p>
											In the scaling up,
											there&#39;s an inherent inadequacy
											to match the needs of the local people,
											point by point, with the supply that you&#39;re making.
											So why are people willing to adjust with that mismatch?
											Things can scale up, and they have scaled up.
											For example, cell phones: We have 400 million cellphones in this country.
											Now, it is possible that I use only two buttons on the cellphone,
											only three options on the cellphone.
											It has 300 options, I&#39;m paying for 300; I&#39;m using only three
											but I&#39;m willing to live with it, therefore it is scaling up.
											But if I had to get a match to match,
											obviously, I would need a different design of a cellphone.
											So what we&#39;re saying is that scalability
											should not become an enemy of sustainability.
											There must be a place in the world
											for solutions that are only relevant for a locality,
											and yet, one can be able to fund them.

									<p>
											One of the greatest studies that we&#39;ve been finding is
											that many times investors would ask this question —
											&quot;What is a scalable model?&quot; —
											as if the need of a community, which is only
											located in a space and time
											and has those needs only located in those places,
											has no legitimate right to get them for free
											because it&#39;s not part of a larger scale.
											So either you sub-optimize your needs to a larger scale
											or else you remain out.
											Now, the eminent model, the long-tail model
											tells you that small sales
											of a large number of books, for example,
											having only a few copies sold
											can still be a viable model.
											And we must find a mechanism where
											people will pool in the portfolio, will invest in the portfolio,
											where different innovations will go to
											a small number of people in their localities,

											But the idea has a merit. The idea has a merit.

											The point is, none of us should be parochial,
											none of us should be so nationalistic to believe
											that all good ideas will come only from our country.
											No, we have to have the humility to learn
											from knowledge of economically poor people, wherever they are.
											And look at this whole range of cycle-based innovations:
											cycle that&#39;s a sprayer, cycle that
											generates energy from the shocks on the road.
											I can&#39;t change the condition of the road,
											but I can make the cycle run faster.
											That is what Kanak Das has done.
											And in South Africa,
											we had taken our innovators,
											and many of us had gone there share with the colleagues in South Africa
											as to how innovation can become
											a means of liberation
											from the drudgery that people have.
											And this is a donkey cart which they modified.
											There&#39;s an axle here, of 30, 40 kg,

In response, he started the Honey Bee Network and began searching the country with colleagues, often on foot, finding a myriad of inventions developed out of necessity. These discoveries are documented and often shared with the global community, just as pollen is gathered by the honeybee to the benefit of both. Since 1988, the network&#39;s database of original inventions has grown to over 12,000, and its newsletter is now published in eight languages and distributed to 75 countries.</p><p>Gupta also worked with the government of India to establish the National Innovation Foundation, which holds national competitions to encourage new inventors and helps sustain them through the National Micro Venture Innovation Fund. Through his efforts, Gupta has uncovered groundbreakingly useful devices such as a pedal-operated washing machine, a micro-windmill battery charger, a hoe powered by a bicycle, and many more. </p>"}],"speaker_name":"Anil Gupta","tags":["creativity","entrepreneur","innovation","invention","poverty","india"],"title":"India's hidden hotbeds of invention","video_type":{"id":"1","name":"TED Stage Talk"},"viewed_count":753573}]}})</script></div>
