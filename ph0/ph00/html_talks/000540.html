											But I want to start with
what I call the &quot;official dogma.&quot;
											The official dogma of what?
											The official dogma of all Western
industrial societies.
											And the official dogma runs like this:
											if we are interested in maximizing
the welfare of our citizens,
											the way to do that
is to maximize individual freedom.
											The reason for this is both
that freedom is, in and of itself, good,
											valuable, worthwhile,
essential to being human,
											and because if people have freedom,
											then each of us can act on our own
											to do the things
that will maximize our welfare,
											and no one has to decide on our behalf.
											The way to maximize freedom
is to maximize choice.

embedded in our lives.

											This is my supermarket.
											Not such a big one.
											I want to say just a word
about salad dressing.
											A hundred seventy-five
salad dressings in my supermarket,
											if you don&#39;t count
the 10 extra-virgin olive oils
											and 12 balsamic vinegars you could buy
											to make a very large number
of your own salad dressings,
											in the off-chance that none of the 175
the store has on offer suit you.
											So this is what the supermarket is like.
											And then you go
to the consumer electronics store
											to set up a stereo system —
											speakers, CD player,
tape player, tuner, amplifier —
											and in this one single
consumer electronics store,
											there are that many stereo systems.
											We can construct six and a half million
different stereo systems
											out of the components
that are on offer in one store.

											You&#39;ve got to admit
that&#39;s a lot of choice.
											In other domains —
the world of communications.
											There was a time, when I was a boy,
											when you could get any kind
of telephone service you wanted,
											as long as it came from Ma Bell.
											You rented your phone, you didn&#39;t buy it.
											One consequence of that, by the way,
is that the phone never broke.
											And those days are gone.
											We now have an almost unlimited
variety of phones,
											especially in the world of cell phones.
											These are cell phones of the future.
											My favorite is the middle one —
											the MP3 player, nose hair trimmer,
and crème brûlée torch.

											So, in other aspects of life that are much
more significant than buying things,
											the same explosion of choice is true.
											Health care.
											It is no longer the case
in the United States
											that you go to the doctor,
and the doctor tells you what to do.
											Instead, you go to the doctor,
											and the doctor tells you,
&quot;Well, we could do A, or we could do B.
											A has these benefits and these risks.
											B has these benefits and these risks.
											What do you want to do?&quot;
											And you say, &quot;Doc, what should I do?&quot;
											And the doc says, &quot;A has
these benefits and risks,
											and B has these benefits and risks.
											What do you want to do?&quot;
											And you say, &quot;If you were me,
Doc, what would you do?&quot;
											And the doc says, &quot;But I&#39;m not you.&quot;
											And the result is —
we call it &quot;patient autonomy,&quot;
											which makes it sound like a good thing,
											but what it really is is a shifting
of the burden and the responsibility
											for decision-making
											from somebody who knows something —
namely, the doctor —
											to somebody who knows nothing
and is almost certainly sick
											and thus, not in the best shape
to be making decisions —
											namely, the patient.
											There&#39;s enormous marketing
of prescription drugs
											to people like you and me,
											which, if you think about it,
makes no sense at all,
											since we can&#39;t buy them.
											Why do they market to us
if we can&#39;t buy them?
											The answer is that they expect us
to call our doctors the next morning
											and ask for our prescriptions
to be changed.

											Something as dramatic as our identity
											has now become a matter of choice,
											as this slide is meant to indicate.
											We don&#39;t inherit an identity;
we get to invent it.
											And we get to reinvent ourselves
as often as we like.
											And that means that every day,
when you wake up in the morning,
											you have to decide
what kind of person you want to be.
											With respect to marriage and family:
											there was a time when the default
assumption that almost everyone had
											is that you got married
as soon as you could,
											and then you started having kids
as soon as you could.

											not when, and not what you did after.

											about whether we should
or shouldn&#39;t be working.

											We all know what&#39;s good about it,
											so I&#39;m going to talk
about what&#39;s bad about it.
											All of this choice has two effects,
											two negative effects on people.
											One effect, paradoxically,
											is that it produces paralysis
rather than liberation.
											With so many options to choose from,
											people find it very difficult
to choose at all.
											I&#39;ll give you one very dramatic
example of this,
											a study that was done of investments
in voluntary retirement plans.
											A colleague of mine got access
to investment records from Vanguard,
											the gigantic mutual fund company,
											of about a million employees
and about 2,000 different workplaces.
											What she found is that for every
10 mutual funds the employer offered,
											rate of participation
went down two percent.
											You offer 50 funds — 10 percent
fewer employees participate
											than if you only offer five.
											Why?
											Because with 50 funds to choose from,
											it&#39;s so damn hard to decide
which fund to choose,
											that you&#39;ll just put it off till tomorrow,
											and then tomorrow
											and then tomorrow and tomorrow,
											and, of course, tomorrow never comes.
											Understand that not only does this mean
											that people are going to have
to eat dog food when they retire
											because they don&#39;t have
enough money put away,
											it also means that making
the decision is so hard
											that they pass up significant
matching money from the employer.
											By not participating, they are passing up
as much as 5,000 dollars a year
											from the employer,
											who would happily
match their contribution.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">

											So paralysis is a consequence
of having too many choices.
											And I think it makes
the world look like this.

											You really want to get the decision right
if it&#39;s for all eternity, right?
											You don&#39;t want to pick the wrong
mutual fund or wrong salad dressing.
											So that&#39;s one effect.
											The second effect is that, even if
we manage to overcome the paralysis
											and make a choice,
											we end up less satisfied
with the result of the choice
											than we would be if we had
fewer options to choose from.
											And there are several reasons for this.
											One of them is, with a lot of different
salad dressings to choose from,
											if you buy one and it&#39;s not perfect —
and what salad dressing is? —
											it&#39;s easy to imagine
that you could&#39;ve made a different choice
											that would&#39;ve been better.
											And what happens is,
											this imagined alternative induces you
to regret the decision you made,
											and this regret subtracts
from the satisfaction you get
											out of the decision you made,
											even if it was a good decision.
											The more options there are,
the easier it is to regret anything at all
											that is disappointing
about the option that you chose.

											Second, what economists

											Dan Gilbert made a big point this morning

in which we value things
											depends on what we compare them to.
											Well, when there are lots
of alternatives to consider,
											it&#39;s easy to imagine the attractive
features of alternatives that you reject

											Third: escalation of expectations.
											This hit me when I went
to replace my jeans.
											I wear jeans almost all the time.
											There was a time
when jeans came in one flavor,
											and you bought them,
and they fit like crap.
											They were incredibly uncomfortable,
											and if you wore them long enough
and washed them enough times,
											they started to feel OK.
											I went to replace my jeans
after years of wearing these old ones.
											I said, &quot;I want a pair of jeans.
Here&#39;s my size.&quot;
											And the shopkeeper said,
											&quot;Do you want slim fit,
easy fit, relaxed fit?
											You want button fly or zipper fly?
You want stonewashed or acid-washed?
											Do you want them distressed?
											Do you want boot cut, tapered?&quot;
Blah, blah, blah on and on he went.
											My jaw dropped.
											And after I recovered, I said,
											&quot;I want the kind that used to be
the only kind.&quot;

											The reason I felt worse is that
with all of these options available,

a pair of jeans should be went up.
											I had very low, no particular expectations
when they only came in one flavor.
											When they came in 100 flavors, damn it,
one of them should&#39;ve been perfect.
											And what I got was good,
but it wasn&#39;t perfect.
											And so I compared what I got
to what I expected,
											and what I got was disappointing
in comparison to what I expected.
											Adding options to people&#39;s lives
											can&#39;t help but increase
the expectations people have
											about how good those options will be.
											And what that&#39;s going to produce
is less satisfaction with results,

											Finally,
											one consequence of buying
a bad-fitting pair of jeans
											when there is only one kind to buy
											is that when you are dissatisfied
and you ask why, who&#39;s responsible,
											the answer is clear:
the world is responsible.
											What could you do?
											When there are hundreds
of different styles of jeans available
											and you buy one that is disappointing
											and you ask why, who&#39;s responsible,
											it is equally clear that the answer
to the question is &quot;you.&quot;
											You could have done better.
											With a hundred different kinds
of jeans on display,
											there is no excuse for failure.
											And so when people make decisions,
											and even though the results
of the decisions are good,
											they feel disappointed about them;
											they blame themselves.

											Clinical depression has exploded
in the industrial world
											in the last generation.
											I believe a significant — not the only,
but a significant — contributor
											to this explosion of depression
and also suicide,
											is that people have experiences
that are disappointing
											because their standards are so high,
											and then when they have to explain
these experiences to themselves,
											they think they&#39;re at fault.
											So the net result is that we do
better in general, objectively,
											and we feel worse.
											So let me remind you:
											this is the official dogma,
the one that we all take to be true,
											and it&#39;s all false.
											It is not true.
											There&#39;s no question that some choice
is better than none.
											But it doesn&#39;t follow from that
											that more choice
is better than some choice.
											There&#39;s some magical amount.
I don&#39;t know what it is.
											I&#39;m pretty confident that we have
long since passed the point
											where options improve our welfare.

											Now, as a policy matter —
I&#39;m almost done —
											as a policy matter,
the thing to think about is this:
											what enables all of this choice
in industrial societies
											is material affluence.
											There are lots of places in the world,
											and we have heard about several of them,
											where their problem is not
that they have too much choice.
											Their problem is they have too little.
											So the stuff I&#39;m talking about
is the peculiar problem
											of modern, affluent, Western societies.
											And what is so frustrating
and infuriating is this:
											Steve Levitt talked to you yesterday
											about how these expensive
and difficult-to-install child seats
											don&#39;t help.
											It&#39;s a waste of money.
											What I&#39;m telling you is that
these expensive, complicated choices —
											it&#39;s not simply that they don&#39;t help.
											They actually hurt.
											They actually make us worse off.

									<p>
											If some of what enables
people in our societies
											to make all of the choices we make
											were shifted to societies
in which people have too few options,
											not only would those
people&#39;s lives be improved,
											but ours would be improved also.
											This is what economists call
a &quot;Pareto-improving move.&quot;
											Income redistribution will make
everyone better off,
											not just poor people,
											because of how all this excess
choice plagues us.

Lately, working with Ken Sharpe, he's studying wisdom.","whylisten":"<p>In his 2004 book <a href=\"http://geni.us/paradoxofchoice\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Paradox of Choice</em></a>, Barry Schwartz tackles one of the great mysteries of modern life: Why is it that societies of great abundance &mdash; where individuals are offered more freedom and choice (personal, professional, material) than ever before &mdash; are now witnessing a near-epidemic of depression? <strong>Conventional wisdom tells us that greater choice is for the greater good, but Schwartz argues the opposite</strong>: He makes a compelling case that the abundance of choice in today&#39;s western world is actually making us miserable. <br /><br /><strong>Infinite choice is paralyzing, Schwartz argues, and exhausting to the human psyche. </strong>It leads us to set unreasonably high expectations, question our choices before we even make them and blame our failures entirely on ourselves. His relatable examples, from consumer products (jeans, TVs, salad dressings) to lifestyle choices (where to live, what job to take, who and when to marry), underscore this central point: Too much choice undermines happiness.<br /><br />Schwartz&#39;s previous research has addressed morality, decision-making and the varied inter-relationships between science and society. Before <em>Paradox</em> he published <a href=\"http://geni.us/costofliving\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Costs of Living</em></a>, which traces the impact of free-market thinking on the explosion of consumerism -- and <strong>the effect of the new capitalism on social and cultural institutions that once operated above the market, such as medicine, sports, and the law</strong>.<br /><br />Both books level serious criticism of modern western society, illuminating the under-reported psychological plagues of our time. But they also offer <strong>concrete ideas on addressing the problems</strong>, from a personal and societal level.</p><p>Schwartz is the author of the TED Book,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://geni.us/whyweworkintl\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Why We Work</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>"}],"url":"https://www.ted.com/talks/barry_schwartz_on_the_paradox_of_choice","viewed_count":13754451,"talks":[{"recommendations":null,"more_resources":[{"status":"approved","headline":"*Why We Work*","blurb":null,"link_url":"http://geni.us/whyweworkintl","image_url":"https://geo-assets.tedcdn.com/barry_schwartz/TEDBook_Schwartz_260x364.jpg","author":"Barry Schwartz","year":"2015","publisher":"TED Books","start_at":null,"end_at":null,"published":true,"eyebrow":"","type":"book"}],"corrections":[],"has_citations":false,"take_action":[],"explore_cta_experiment":{},"curator_approved":true,"description":"Psychologist Barry Schwartz takes aim at a central tenet of western societies: freedom of choice.

choosing a health-care plan, choosing a college class or even buying a pair of jeans, Schwartz shows that a bewildering array of choices floods our exhausted brains, ultimately restricting instead of freeing us.","whotheyare":"Barry Schwartz studies the link between economics and psychology, offering startling insights into modern life. Lately, working with Ken Sharpe, he's studying wisdom.","whylisten":"<p>In his 2004 book <a href=\"http://geni.us/paradoxofchoice\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Paradox of Choice</em></a>, Barry Schwartz tackles one of the great mysteries of modern life: Why is it that societies of great abundance &mdash; where individuals are offered more freedom and choice (personal, professional, material) than ever before &mdash; are now witnessing a near-epidemic of depression? <strong>Conventional wisdom tells us that greater choice is for the greater good, but Schwartz argues the opposite</strong>: He makes a compelling case that the abundance of choice in today&#39;s western world is actually making us miserable. <br /><br /><strong>Infinite choice is paralyzing, Schwartz argues, and exhausting to the human psyche. </strong>It leads us to set unreasonably high expectations, question our choices before we even make them and blame our failures entirely on ourselves. His relatable examples, from consumer products (jeans, TVs, salad dressings) to lifestyle choices (where to live, what job to take, who and when to marry), underscore this central point: Too much choice undermines happiness.<br /><br />Schwartz&#39;s previous research has addressed morality, decision-making and the varied inter-relationships between science and society. Before <em>Paradox</em> he published <a href=\"http://geni.us/costofliving\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Costs of Living</em></a>, which traces the impact of free-market thinking on the explosion of consumerism -- and <strong>the effect of the new capitalism on social and cultural institutions that once operated above the market, such as medicine, sports, and the law</strong>.<br /><br />Both books level serious criticism of modern western society, illuminating the under-reported psychological plagues of our time. But they also offer <strong>concrete ideas on addressing the problems</strong>, from a personal and societal level.</p><p>Schwartz is the author of the TED Book,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://geni.us/whyweworkintl\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Why We Work</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>"}],"speaker_name":"Barry Schwartz","tags":["business","choice","culture","decision-making","economics","happiness","personal growth","potential","psychology"],"title":"The paradox of choice","video_type":{"id":"1","name":"TED Stage Talk"},"viewed_count":13754451}]}})</script></div>
