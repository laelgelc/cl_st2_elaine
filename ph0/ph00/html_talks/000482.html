											The immersive ugliness

											We can&#39;t overestimate the amount of despair

											There are a lot of ways you can describe this.
											You know, I like to call it &quot;the national automobile slum.&quot;
											You can call it suburban sprawl.
											I think it&#39;s appropriate to call it
											the greatest misallocation of resources in the history of the world.
											You can call it a technosis externality clusterfuck.
											And it&#39;s a tremendous problem for us.
											The outstanding — the salient problem about this for us
											is that these are places that are not worth caring about.
											We&#39;re going to talk about that some more.
											A sense of place:
											your ability to create places that are meaningful and places of quality and character
											depends entirely on your ability to define space with buildings,
											and to employ the vocabularies, grammars,
											syntaxes, rhythms and patterns of architecture
											in order to inform us who we are.

											The public realm in America has two roles:
											it is the dwelling place of our civilization and our civic life,
											and it is the physical manifestation of the common good.
											And when you degrade the public realm,
											you will automatically degrade the quality of your civic life
											and the character of all the enactments of your public life and communal life that take place there.
											The public realm comes mostly in the form of the street in America
											because we don&#39;t have the 1,000-year-old cathedral plazas
											and market squares of older cultures.
											And your ability to define space and to create places that are worth caring about
											all comes from a body of culture that we call the culture of civic design.
											This is a body of knowledge, method, skill and principle
											that we threw in the garbage after World War II
											and decided we don&#39;t need that anymore; we&#39;re not going to use it.
											And consequently, we can see the result all around us.
											The public realm has to inform us not only where we are geographically,
											but it has to inform us where we are in our culture.
											Where we&#39;ve come from, what kind of people we are, and it needs to,
											by doing that, it needs to afford us a glimpse to where we&#39;re going
											in order to allow us to dwell in a hopeful present.
											And if there is one tremendous —
											if there is one great catastrophe about the places that we&#39;ve built,
											the human environments we&#39;ve made for ourselves in the last 50 years,
											it is that it has deprived us of the ability to live in a hopeful present.

											The environments we are living in, more typically, are like these.
											You know, this happens to be the asteroid belt of architectural garbage two miles north of my town.
											And remember, to create a place of character and quality,
											you have to be able to define space.
											So how is that being accomplished here?
											If you stand on the apron of the Wal-Mart over here
											and try to look at the Target store over here,
											you can&#39;t see it because of the curvature of the Earth. (Laughter)
											That&#39;s nature&#39;s way of telling you that you&#39;re doing a poor job of defining space.
											Consequently, these will be places that nobody wants to be in.
											These will be places that are not worth caring about.

											and ask yourself, &quot;What is their last thought of home?&quot;

											Public space. This is a good public space.
											It&#39;s a place worth caring about. It&#39;s well defined.
											It is emphatically an outdoor public room.
											It has something that is terribly important —
											it has what&#39;s called an active and permeable membrane around the edge.
											That&#39;s a fancy way of saying it&#39;s got shops, bars, bistros, destinations —
											things go in and out of it. It&#39;s permeable.
											The beer goes in and out, the waitresses go in and out,
											and that activates the center of this place and makes it a place that people want to hang out in.
											You know, in these places in other cultures,
											people just go there voluntarily because they like them.
											We don&#39;t have to have a craft fair here to get people to come here. (Laughter)

											Probably the most significant public space failure in America,

											A public place so dismal that the winos don&#39;t even want to go there. (Laughter)

											You can see exactly what went on, three o&#39;clock in the morning at the design meeting.
											You know, eight hours before deadline,
											four architects trying to get this building in on time, right?
											And they&#39;re sitting there at the long boardroom table

											and all the Chinese food caskets are lying on the table, and —

											The pattern of Main Street USA —
											in fact, this pattern of building downtown blocks, all over the world, is fairly universal.
											It&#39;s not that complicated:
											buildings more than one story high, built out to the sidewalk edge,
											so that people who are, you know, all kinds of people can get into the building.
											Other activities are allowed to occur upstairs,
											you know, apartments, offices, and so on.
											You make provision for this activity called shopping on the ground floor.
											They haven&#39;t learned that in Monterey.
											If you go out to the corner right at the main intersection right in front of this conference center,
											you&#39;ll see an intersection with four blank walls on every corner.

											Anyway, this is how you compose and assemble a downtown business building,
											and this is what happened when in Glens Falls, New York,
											when we tried to do it again, where it was missing, right?
											So the first thing they do is they pop up the retail a half a story above grade to make it sporty.
											OK. That completely destroys the relationship between the business and the sidewalk,
											where the theoretical pedestrians are. (Laughter)
											Of course, they&#39;ll never be there, as long as this is in that condition.
											Then because the relationship between the retail is destroyed,
											we pop a handicapped ramp on that,
											and then to make ourselves feel better, we put a nature Band-Aid in front of it.
											And that&#39;s how we do it.
											I call them &quot;nature Band-Aids&quot; because there&#39;s a general idea in America
											that the remedy for mutilated urbanism is nature.
											And in fact, the remedy for wounded and mutilated urbanism is good urbanism, good buildings.
											Not just flower beds, not just cartoons of the Sierra Nevada Mountains.
											You know, that&#39;s not good enough.

											to filter the sunlight onto the sidewalk,
											and to soften the hardscape of the buildings
											and to create a ceiling — a vaulted ceiling — over the street, at its best.

											You know, one of the problems with the fiasco of suburbia is that it destroyed our understanding
											of the distinction between the country and the town, between the urban and the rural.
											They&#39;re not the same thing.
											And we&#39;re not going to cure the problems of the urban by dragging the country into the city,
											which is what a lot of us are trying to do all the time.
											Here you see it on a small scale — the mothership has landed,

											A lot of this comes from the fact that the industrial city in America was such a trauma
											that we developed this tremendous aversion for the whole idea of the city,
											city life, and everything connected with it.
											And so what you see fairly early, in the mid-19th century,
											is this idea that we now have to have an antidote to the industrial city,
											which is going to be life in the country for everybody.
											And that starts to be delivered in the form of the railroad suburb:
											the country villa along the railroad line,
											which allows people to enjoy the amenity of the city,
											but to return to the countryside every night.
											And believe me, there were no Wal-Marts or convenience stores out there then,
											so it really was a form of country living.
