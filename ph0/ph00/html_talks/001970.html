<title>Jessica Shortall: The US needs paid family leave -- for the sake of its future | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: We need women to work, and we need working women to have babies. So why is America one of the only countries in the world that offers no national paid leave to new working mothers? In this incisive talk, Jessica Shortall makes the impassioned case that the reality of new working motherhood in America is both hidden and horrible: millions of women, every year, are forced back to work within just weeks of giving birth. Her idea worth spreading: the time has come for us to recognize the economic, physical and psychological costs of our approach to working mothers and their babies, and to secure our economic future by providing paid leave to all working parents." />

<meta content='The US needs paid family leave — for the sake of its future' itemprop='name'>
<meta content='We need women to work, and we need working women to have babies. So why is America one of the only countries in the world that offers no national paid leave to new working mothers? In this incisive talk, Jessica Shortall makes the impassioned case that the reality of new working motherhood in America is both hidden and horrible: millions of women, every year, are forced back to work within just weeks of giving birth. Her idea worth spreading: the time has come for us to recognize the economic, physical and psychological costs of our approach to working mothers and their babies, and to secure our economic future by providing paid leave to all working parents.' itemprop='description'>

											I want to break this choice thing

that women have chosen to work.

											Today in America, women make up
47 percent of the workforce,

											a woman is the sole
or primary breadwinner.
											Our paid work is a part, a huge part,
of the engine of this economy,

											On a national level,
our paid work is not optional.

											Choice number two says that women
are choosing to have babies,
											so women alone should bear
the consequences of those choices.
											You know, that&#39;s one of those things
											that when you hear it in passing,
can sound correct.
											I didn&#39;t make you have a baby.
											I certainly wasn&#39;t there
when that happened.
											But that stance
ignores a fundamental truth,
											which is that our procreation
on a national scale is not optional.
											The babies that women, many of them
working women, are having today,
											will one day fill our workforce,
protect our shores,
											make up our tax base.
											Our procreation
on a national scale is not optional.
											These aren&#39;t choices.
											We need women to work.
We need working women to have babies.
											So we should make
doing those things at the same time
											at least palatable, right?

											OK, this is pop quiz time:
											what percentage of working

was considered a preexisting condition.
											We used up all of our tax returns

											Remember that 88 percent?
											Those middle- and low-income women
are not going to participate in that.
											We know that there are staggering
economic, financial, physical
											and emotional costs to this approach.
											We have decided —
decided, not an accident,
											to pass these costs directly
on to working mothers and their babies.
											We know the price tag is higher
for low-income women,
											therefore disproportionately
for women of color.
											We pass them on anyway.

											The birthrate needed in America
to keep the population stable

											In America today, we are at 1.86.
											We need women to have babies,

working women from doing that.

											I&#39;m here today with only
one idea worth spreading,
											and you&#39;ve guessed what it is.
											It is long since time
for the most powerful country on Earth
											to offer national paid leave
											to the people doing the work
of the future of this country
											and to the babies
who represent that future.
											Childbirth is a public good.
											This leave should be state-subsidized.
											It should have no exceptions
for small businesses,
											length of employment or entrepreneurs.
											It should be able
to be shared between partners.
											I&#39;ve talked today a lot about mothers,
											but co-parents matter on so many levels.

											Not one more woman
should have to go back to work
											while she is hobbling and bleeding.
											Not one more family should have
to drain their savings account
											to buy a few days

											Not one more fragile infant
											should have to go directly
from the incubator to day care
											because his parents have used up
all of their meager time

											The catch is that when this is happening
to a new family, it is consuming,
											and a family with a new baby
is more financially vulnerable
											than they&#39;ve ever been before,
											so that new mother cannot afford
to speak up on her own behalf.
											But all of us have voices.
											I am done, done having babies,

											you might be post-baby,

They all require an intense dive into data, and they all benefit from powerful storytelling.</p> <p class=\"p1\">Shortall has provided strategy consulting to dozens of businesses, social enterprises, non-profit organizations and campaigns in the US, UK and beyond. Her first book,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://geni.us/workpumprepeat\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Work. Pump. Repeat: The New Mom&#39;s Guide to Surviving Breastfeeding and Going Back to Work</em></a>, was inspired by her own experiences of circumnavigating the globe with a breast pump. She interviewed hundreds of working mothers and dozens of HR professionals to create a practical, relatable, judgment-free guide for women who want to try to continue breastfeeding after they&#39;ve returned to work.</p> <p class=\"p1\">Shortall started her adult life as a Peace Corps Volunteer in Uzbekistan, and she haven&#39;t stopped searching for ways to change the world since, across non-profit and for-profit worlds. In the early 2000s, she co-founded and franchised a non-profit organization that is now active in more than 40 communities. In 2006, she received an MBA with honors from the University of Oxford, as a Skoll Scholar in Social Entrepreneurship. She went on to spend three years providing consulting services to social entrepreneurs. From 2009 to 2014, she was the first Director of Giving at TOMS Shoes, hired to build out the now-iconic One for One giving mission and strategy.&nbsp;</p> <p class=\"p1\">She currently lives in Dallas, TX with her husband Clay and her two children.</p>"}],"url":"https://www.ted.com/talks/jessica_shortall_how_america_fails_new_parents_and_their_babies","viewed_count":1505720,"talks":[{"explore_cta_experiment":{},"curator_approved":true,"description":"We need women to work, and we need working women to have babies.

working mom of two and author of Work.

Repeat: The New Mom's Survival Guide to Breastfeeding and Going Back to Work.","whylisten":"<p class=\"p1\">What do breastfeeding and paid leave for working mothers, sustainable eye care, hunger, green investing, giving shoes and the business case for LGBT equality have in common?&nbsp;</p> <p class=\"p1\">For Jessica Shortall, they have all been opportunities to change the world: challenges that need sustainable solutions and require a deep understanding of market forces, audiences, and cultures. They all require an intense dive into data, and they all benefit from powerful storytelling.</p> <p class=\"p1\">Shortall has provided strategy consulting to dozens of businesses, social enterprises, non-profit organizations and campaigns in the US, UK and beyond. Her first book,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://geni.us/workpumprepeat\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Work. Pump. Repeat: The New Mom&#39;s Guide to Surviving Breastfeeding and Going Back to Work</em></a>, was inspired by her own experiences of circumnavigating the globe with a breast pump. She interviewed hundreds of working mothers and dozens of HR professionals to create a practical, relatable, judgment-free guide for women who want to try to continue breastfeeding after they&#39;ve returned to work.</p> <p class=\"p1\">Shortall started her adult life as a Peace Corps Volunteer in Uzbekistan, and she haven&#39;t stopped searching for ways to change the world since, across non-profit and for-profit worlds. In the early 2000s, she co-founded and franchised a non-profit organization that is now active in more than 40 communities. In 2006, she received an MBA with honors from the University of Oxford, as a Skoll Scholar in Social Entrepreneurship. She went on to spend three years providing consulting services to social entrepreneurs. From 2009 to 2014, she was the first Director of Giving at TOMS Shoes, hired to build out the now-iconic One for One giving mission and strategy.&nbsp;</p> <p class=\"p1\">She currently lives in Dallas, TX with her husband Clay and her two children.</p>"}],"speaker_name":"Jessica Shortall","tags":["activism","big problems","economics","future","humanity","family","health","health care","government","parenting","society","social change","work","TEDx","women in business","women"],"title":"The US needs paid family leave -- for the sake of its future","video_type":{"id":"2","name":"TEDx Talk"},"viewed_count":1505720}]}})</script></div>
