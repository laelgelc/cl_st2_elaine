<meta content='Netflix changed the world of entertainment — first with DVD-by-mail, then with streaming media and then again with sensational original shows like "Orange Is the New Black" and "Stranger Things" — but not without taking its fair share of risks. In conversation with TED curator Chris Anderson, Netflix co-founder and CEO Reed Hastings discusses the company&#x0027;s bold internal culture, the powerful algorithm that fuels their recommendations, the $8 billion worth of content they&#x0027;re investing in this year and his philanthropic pursuits supporting innovative education, among much more.' itemprop='description'>

											Chris Anderson: I have been long
so fascinated and amazed
											by so many aspects of Netflix.
											You&#39;re full of surprises, if I may say so.
											One of those surprises happened,
I think about six years ago.
											So, the company back then
was doing really well,
											but you were basically a streaming service
											for other people&#39;s films and TV content.
											You&#39;d persuaded Wall Street
that you were right
											to make the kind of radical shift
away from just sending people DVDs,
											so you were doing it by streaming.
											And you were growing like a weed —
											you had more than six million subscribers
and healthy growth rates,
											and yet, you chose that moment
											to kind of make a giant —
really, a bet-the-company decision.
											What was that decision,
and what motivated it?

											Reed Hastings: Well,
cable networks from all time
											have started on other people&#39;s content
											and then grown into doing
their own originals.
											So we knew of the general idea
for quite a while.
											And we had actually tried to get into
original content back in 2005,
											when we were on DVD only
and buying films at Sundance —
											Maggie Gyllenhaal, &quot;Sherrybaby,&quot;
we published on DVD —
											we were a mini studio.
											And it didn&#39;t work out,
because we were subscale.
											And then, as you said, in 2011,
											Ted Sarandos, my partner at Netflix
who runs content,
											got very excited about &quot;House of Cards.&quot;
											And at that time,
it was 100 million dollars,
											it was a fantastic investment,
											and it was in competition with HBO.
											And that was really the breakthrough,
that he picked right upfront.

											RH: Well, you know,
we had grown up shipping DVDs.

box sets, on DVD.
											And all of us had that experience
watching some of the great HBO content

next episode, next episode.
											And so that was the trigger
to make us think,
											wow, you know, with episodic content,
especially serialized,
											it&#39;s so powerful to have
all the episodes at once.
											And it&#39;s something
that linear TV can&#39;t do.

making the brand stronger,

											RH: Well, you know, my first company —
we were very process obsessed.
											This was in the 1990s.
											And every time someone made a mistake,
											we tried to put a process in place
											to make sure that mistake
didn&#39;t happen again —
											so, very semiconductor-yield orientation.
											And the problem is, we were trying
to dummy-proof the system.
											And then, eventually,
only dummies wanted to work there.
											Then, of course, the market shifted —
in that case, it was C++ to Java.
											But you know, there&#39;s always some shift.
											And the company was unable to adapt,
											and it got acquired
by our largest competitor.
											And so with Netflix, I was super focused
on how to run with no process
											but not have chaos.
											And so then we&#39;ve developed
all these mechanisms,
											super high-talented people, alignment,
											talking openly, sharing information —
											internally, people are stunned
at how much information —
											all the core strategies, etc.
											We&#39;re like the &quot;anti-Apple&quot; —
you know how they compartmentalize?
											We do the opposite, which is:
everybody gets all the information.
											So what we&#39;re trying to do is build
a sense of responsibility in people
											and the ability to do things.
											I find out about big decisions now

											RH: Sure. Right out of college,
I was a high school math teacher.
											So when I later went into business
and became a philanthropist,
											I think I gravitated towards education
											and trying to make a difference there.
											And the main thing I noticed is, you know,
											educators want to work
with other great educators
											and to create many
unique environments for kids.
											And we need a lot more
variety in the system
											than we have,
											and a lot more
educator-centric organizations.
											And so the tricky thing is,
right now in the US,
											most schools are run
by a local school board.
											And it has to meet all needs
in the community,
											and, in fact, what we need
is a lot more variety.
											So in the US there&#39;s a form
of public school
											called charter public schools,
that are run by nonprofits.
											And that&#39;s the big emphasis for me,
											is if you can have schools
run by nonprofits,
											they are more mission-focused,
they support the educators well.
											I&#39;m on the board of KIPP charter schools,
											which is one of the larger networks.
											And, you know, it&#39;s 30,000 kids a year
getting very stimulating education.

											CA: Paint me a picture of what
a school should look like.
											RH: It depends on the kid.
											Think about it as: with multiple
kids, there&#39;s all different needs
											that need to be met,
											so there&#39;s not any one model.
											And you want to be able to choose,
											depending on your kid
and what you think they need.
											But they should be very educator-centric
and curious and stimulating
											and all of those things.
											And this whole idea
of 30 kids in fifth grade,
											all learning the same thing
at the same time,
											you know, is clearly
an industrial throwback.
											But changing that, given
the current government structure,
											is super hard.
											But what these innovative, nonprofit
schools are doing is pushing the bounds,
											letting kids try new things.
											And so think of it as
the governance reform,
											that is, the nonprofit,
											to allow the educational changes.

get in trouble,
											the parents will send them
to a private school
											or they move neighborhoods.
											And low-income families generally

He spent his early years in India, Pakistan and Afghanistan, where his parents worked as medical missionaries, and he attended an American school in the Himalayas for his early education. After boarding school in Bath, England, he went on to Oxford University, graduating in 1978 with a degree in philosophy, politics and economics.</p><p class=\"p1\">Chris then trained as a journalist, working in newspapers and radio, including two years producing a world news service in the Seychelles Islands.</p><p class=\"p1\"> Back in the UK in 1984, Chris was captivated by the personal computer revolution and became an editor at one of the UK&#39;s early computer magazines. A year later he founded Future Publishing with a $25,000 bank loan. The new company initially focused on specialist computer publications but eventually expanded into other areas such as cycling, music, video games, technology and design, doubling in size every year for seven years. In 1994, Chris moved to the United States where he built Imagine Media, publisher of <em>Business 2.0</em> magazine and creator of the popular video game users website IGN. Chris eventually merged Imagine and Future, taking the combined entity public in London in 1999, under the Future name. At its peak, it published 150 magazines and websites and employed 2,000 people.</p><p class=\"p1\">This success allowed Chris to create a private nonprofit organization, the Sapling Foundation, with the hope of finding new ways to tackle tough global issues through media, technology, entrepreneurship and, most of all, ideas. In 2001, the foundation acquired the TED Conference, then an annual meeting of luminaries in the fields of Technology, Entertainment and Design held in Monterey, California, and Chris left Future to work full time on TED.</p><p class=\"p1\">He expanded the conference&#39;s remit to cover all topics, including science, business and key global issues, while adding a Fellows program, which now has some 300 alumni, and the TED Prize, which grants its recipients &quot;one wish to change the world.&quot; The TED stage has become a place for thinkers and doers from all fields to share their ideas and their work, capturing imaginations, sparking conversation and encouraging discovery along the way.</p><p class=\"p1\">In 2006, TED experimented with posting some of its talks on the Internet. Their viral success encouraged Chris to begin positioning the organization as a global media initiative devoted to &#39;ideas worth spreading,&#39; part of a new era of information dissemination using the power of online video. In June 2015, the organization posted its 2,000th talk online. The talks are free to view, and they have been translated into more than 100 languages with the help of volunteers from around the world. Viewership has grown to approximately one billion views per year.</p><p class=\"p1\">Continuing a strategy of &#39;radical openness,&#39; in 2009 Chris introduced the TEDx initiative, allowing free licenses to local organizers who wished to organize their own TED-like events.
