<title>Bryan Stevenson: We need to talk about an injustice | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: In an engaging and personal talk -- with cameo appearances from his grandmother and Rosa Parks -- human rights lawyer Bryan Stevenson shares some hard truths about America&#39;s justice system, starting with a massive imbalance along racial lines: a third of the country&#39;s black male population has been incarcerated at some point in their lives. These issues, which are wrapped up in America&#39;s unexamined history, are rarely talked about with this level of candor, insight and persuasiveness." />

<meta content="In an engaging and personal talk — with cameo appearances from his grandmother and Rosa Parks — human rights lawyer Bryan Stevenson shares some hard truths about America's justice system, starting with a massive imbalance along racial lines: a third of the country's black male population has been incarcerated at some point in their lives. These issues, which are wrapped up in America's unexamined history, are rarely talked about with this level of candor, insight and persuasiveness." itemprop='description'>

											Well this is a really extraordinary honor for me.
											I spend most of my time
											in jails, in prisons, on death row.
											I spend most of my time in very low-income communities
											in the projects and places where there&#39;s a great deal of hopelessness.
											And being here at TED
											and seeing the stimulation, hearing it,
											has been very, very energizing to me.
											And one of the things that&#39;s emerged in my short time here
											is that TED has an identity.
											And you can actually say things here
											that have impacts around the world.
											And sometimes when it comes through TED,
											it has meaning and power
											that it doesn&#39;t have when it doesn&#39;t.

											And I think what we&#39;ve learned

											but if you&#39;re a compassionate teacher,
											they can be especially meaningful.
											If you&#39;re a doctor you can do some good things,
											but if you&#39;re a caring doctor you can do some other things.
											And so I want to talk about the power of identity.
											And I didn&#39;t learn about this actually
											practicing law and doing the work that I do.
											I actually learned about this from my grandmother.

											I grew up in a house

											She was tough, she was strong,

											She was the end of every argument in our family.
											She was the beginning of a lot of arguments in our family.
											She was the daughter of people who were actually enslaved.
											Her parents were born in slavery in Virginia in the 1840&#39;s.
											She was born in the 1880&#39;s

											very much shaped the way she saw the world.

											and then she&#39;d let me go.
											And an hour or two later, if I saw her,
											she&#39;d come over to me and she&#39;d say, &quot;Bryan, do you still feel me hugging you?&quot;
											And if I said, &quot;No,&quot; she&#39;d assault me again,
											and if I said, &quot;Yes,&quot; she&#39;d leave me alone.
											And she just had this quality
											that you always wanted to be near her.
											And the only challenge was that she had 10 children.
											My mom was the youngest of her 10 kids.
											And sometimes when I would go and spend time with her,

											I said, &quot;No, no, no. That&#39;s okay. You all go ahead. I&#39;m not going to have any beer.&quot;
											My brother said, &quot;Come on. We&#39;re doing this today; you always do what we do.
											I had some, your sister had some. Have some beer.&quot;
											I said, &quot;No, I don&#39;t feel right about that. Y&#39;all go ahead. Y&#39;all go ahead.&quot;
											And then my brother started staring at me.
											He said, &quot;What&#39;s wrong with you? Have some beer.&quot;
											Then he looked at me real hard and he said,
											&quot;Oh, I hope you&#39;re not still hung up

											Well I&#39;ve been trying to say something
											about our criminal justice system.
											This country is very different today
											than it was 40 years ago.
											In 1972, there were 300,000 people in jails and prisons.
											Today, there are 2.3 million.
											The United States now has the highest rate of incarceration
											in the world.
											We have seven million people on probation and parole.
											And mass incarceration, in my judgment,
											has fundamentally changed our world.
											In poor communities, in communities of color
											there is this despair,
											there is this hopelessness,
											that is being shaped by these outcomes.
											One out of three black men
											between the ages of 18 and 30
											is in jail, in prison, on probation or parole.
											In urban communities across this country —
											Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington —
											50 to 60 percent of all young men of color are
											in jail or prison or on probation or parole.

											I had the great privilege, when I was a young lawyer, of meeting Rosa Parks.
											And Ms. Parks used to come back to Montgomery every now and then,
											and she would get together with two of her dearest friends,
											these older women,
											Johnnie Carr who was the organizer
											of the Montgomery bus boycott —
											amazing African-American woman —
											and Virginia Durr, a white woman,
											whose husband, Clifford Durr, represented Dr. King.

											And I actually believe that the TED community
											needs to be more courageous.
											We need to find ways
											to embrace these challenges,
											these problems, the suffering.
											Because ultimately, our humanity depends
											on everyone&#39;s humanity.
											I&#39;ve learned very simple things doing the work that I do.
											It&#39;s just taught me very simple things.
											I&#39;ve come to understand and to believe
											that each of us
											is more than the worst thing we&#39;ve ever done.
											I believe that for every person on the planet.
											I think if somebody tells a lie, they&#39;re not just a liar.
											I think if somebody takes something that doesn&#39;t belong to them,
											they&#39;re not just a thief.
											I think even if you kill someone, you&#39;re not just a killer.
											And because of that there&#39;s this basic human dignity
											that must be respected by law.
											I also believe
											that in many parts of this country,
											and certainly in many parts of this globe,
											that the opposite of poverty is not wealth.
											I don&#39;t believe that.
											I actually think, in too many places,
											the opposite of poverty is justice.

											And finally, I believe
											that, despite the fact that it is so dramatic
											and so beautiful and so inspiring
											and so stimulating,
											we will ultimately not be judged by our technology,
											we won&#39;t be judged by our design,
											we won&#39;t be judged by our intellect and reason.
											Ultimately, you judge the character of a society,
											not by how they treat their rich and the powerful and the privileged,
											but by how they treat the poor,
											the condemned, the incarcerated.
											Because it&#39;s in that nexus
											that we actually begin to understand truly profound things
											about who we are.

											I sometimes get out of balance. I&#39;ll end with this story.
											I sometimes push too hard.
											I do get tired, as we all do.
											Sometimes those ideas get ahead of our thinking
											in ways that are important.
											And I&#39;ve been representing these kids
											who have been sentenced to do these very harsh sentences.
											And I go to the jail and I see my client who&#39;s 13 and 14,
											and he&#39;s been certified to stand trial as an adult.
											I start thinking, well, how did that happen?
											How can a judge turn you into something
											that you&#39;re not?

											the judge must have magic power.
											Yeah, Bryan, the judge has some magic power.
											You should ask for some of that.
											And because I was up too late, wasn&#39;t thinking real straight,
											I started working on a motion.
											And I had a client who was 14 years old, a young, poor black kid.
											And I started working on this motion,

											BS: Well there are opportunities all around us.
											If you live in the state of California, for example,
											there&#39;s a referendum coming up this spring
											where actually there&#39;s going to be an effort
											to redirect some of the money we spend on the politics of punishment.
											For example, here in California
											we&#39;re going to spend one billion dollars
											on the death penalty in the next five years —
											one billion dollars.
											And yet, 46 percent of all homicide cases
											don&#39;t result in arrest.
											56 percent of all rape cases don&#39;t result.
											So there&#39;s an opportunity to change that.
											And this referendum would propose having those dollars

											BS: Well actually the violent crime rate
											has remained relatively stable.
											The great increase in mass incarceration in this country
											wasn&#39;t really in violent crime categories.
											It was this misguided war on drugs.
											That&#39;s where the dramatic increases have come
											in our prison population.
											And we got carried away with the rhetoric of punishment.
											And so we have three strikes laws
											that put people in prison forever
											for stealing a bicycle, for low-level property crimes,
											rather than making them give those resources back
											to the people who they victimized.
											I believe we need to do more to help people who are victimized by crime,
											not do less.

											does nothing for no one.
