<title>Lyra McKee: How uncomfortable conversations can save lives | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Growing up as a gay teen in Northern Ireland, Lyra McKee had her share of disagreements with the Church and, as a journalist in her 20s, found herself estranged from religious institutions. It wasn&#39;t until 2017 and an unexpected conversation about LGBTQ rights in an Orlando mosque that she found herself reckoning with the influence of religion on marginalized lives. &quot;I realized that I couldn&#39;t run away from religion anymore because religion shapes how LGBT people are treated in the world,&quot; she says. In this hopeful talk, she points out plentiful evidence that religious institutions are capable of embracing LGBTQ rights and that the process begins with having that first difficult conversation." />

<meta content='How uncomfortable conversations can save lives' itemprop='name'>
<meta content='Growing up as a gay teen in Northern Ireland, Lyra McKee had her share of disagreements with the Church and, as a journalist in her 20s, found herself estranged from religious institutions. It wasn&#x0027;t until 2017 and an unexpected conversation about LGBTQ rights in an Orlando mosque that she found herself reckoning with the influence of religion on marginalized lives. "I realized that I couldn&#x0027;t run away from religion anymore because religion shapes how LGBT people are treated in the world," she says. In this hopeful talk, she points out plentiful evidence that religious institutions are capable of embracing LGBTQ rights and that the process begins with having that first difficult conversation.' itemprop='description'>

									<p>
											There are people in the world
who if they&#39;re telling you a story
											need to tell you 19 other stories first
before they can get to the point.
											I&#39;m one of those people.
											I want to tell you a story about
a conversation I witnessed in a mosque,
											which changed my life.
											But to tell you that story,
I have to tell you another story first,
											and I&#39;ve only got 12 minutes.
											And that story starts
in late night, early June, this year.
											I got the opportunity to go
on a trip to the United States
											with a delegation from around the UK -
I was the only one from Northern Ireland -
											and we were going there
to learn about &#39;American values&#39;.
											We were going to be travelling
across Washington, Florida, and Texas,
											meeting with everyone
from guns rights lobbyists
											to religious leaders and LGBT groups,
											people who spanned the spectrum
of American values.
											So the thing about these trips
is they offer you a number of perks.
											They offer you carrots
they can dangle in front of you
											whenever the going gets tough,
											when you are in the 100th
meeting of the day
											with someone whose views you find
absolutely reprehensible
											and you&#39;re really struggling
to stay the course.
											In our case, they took us to Disneyland,
											which I can confirm is definitely
one of the happiest places on earth.
											I was in my element.
											Then they took us to NASA,
which, as a Star Wars nerd,
											I have to say, competed in my heart for
the title of &#39;Happiest Place on Earth&#39;.
											Someone very helpful pointed out to me -
											because I was posting
selfies of myself at that time,
											running around Florida in vest tops -
											and someone very helpfully pointed out
											that I seemed to have
more vests than Rab C. Nesbitt.
											(Laughter)
											I know the theme
of the conference is &#39;bridges&#39;:
											I felt like burning that one,
to be quite frank.
											Then we got to go to this beautiful
beachside resort called Cocoa Beach
											and sip cocktails on the beach;
it was absolutely wonderful.
											You&#39;re probably thinking,
&quot;Where do I sign up for this trip?&quot;
											&quot;This sounds amazing, it&#39;s a free jolly!&quot;
											That&#39;s what I thought it was
when I looked at the itinerary.
											But I had to go through hell
to get these perks.
											I realise that Disneyland and NASA,
											that these were all carrots
they were dangling in front of us,
											whenever I found myself
less than 10 feet away
											from the chief orangutan
in the White House.
											(Laughter)
											El Trump.
											People ask me, &quot;What&#39;s the hardest thing

											about standing 10 feet away
from Donald Trump?&quot;
											I think it was seeing how badly
his fake tan was applied.
											(Laughter)
											I did redeem my conscience
when I got to Florida, I should say,
											and we met these lovely protestors,
											who, in case you can&#39;t see,
are holding a &#39;Stop Trump&#39; sign.
											They were right up my alley;
I thought they were fantastic.
											Our next visit was to a place
called the National Rifle Association.
											It is all the guns rights lobbyists who
come out in wake of every mass shooting
											and defend the right
of Americans to bear arms.
											For a number of people in the group,

											this was the most
difficult part of the trip.
											They found it very difficult to sit there
and listen and exchange views,
											which was what the whole trip was about.
											For me though, the hardest part
of the trip was when we got to Orlando
											and they told us we were
going to be visiting a mosque.
											Now you ask yourself,
											Why would I find it hard
to visit a mosque?
											Well, for those of you
who don&#39;t have Gaydar,
											I&#39;m gay - don&#39;t worry,
you can laugh, it&#39;s okay.
											(Laughter)
											I hated myself for much of my life
because of what religion taught me
											about people like me.
											And when I stopped hating myself, 
I started hating religion.
											But I was intrigued by this mosque
because it was in Orlando,
											and a year to the week
that we were in Orlando,
											49 people were slaughtered
in a gay nightclub called Pulse.
											This mosque had led the response
to that tragedy and had condemned it.
											I was intrigued by that.
											This was at a time
when Christian churches in Orlando
											were refusing to bury some of the dead
because they were gay.
											To have a mosque come out
and condemn this was a big deal.
											One of the victims of Pulse
that always stuck with me
											was Brenda Marquez Mccool.
											She was a woman who was out
with her gay son that night in Pulse,
											supporting him.
											When the gunman unleashed his bullets, 
she threw herself in front of her son.
											He survived but she didn&#39;t.
											So I decided that I would go
into this mosque with an open mind.
											I did, and we met
with this lovely man called Bassem,
											who was one of the leaders in the mosque.
											We talked about everything,
											and eventually, Bassem and I
had a conversation
											about LGBT rights and what Muslims
think of gay people.
											Difficult, thorny subject,
but we had a really pleasant conversation,
											but neither of us knew
what was about to happen next.
											There was a young man on our trip
who I&#39;ll call Mahmud, a young Muslim man.
											He was listening to the exchange
between Bassem and I,
											and when we were finished talking,
he spoke up and addressed Bassem.
											And he said, &quot;My best friend was gay,
he was Muslim, and he comitted suicide.&quot;
											And at this point,
Mahmud burst into tears.
											He said, &quot;I did everything I could
to save him, but I couldn&#39;t.&quot;
											And he told us this story
											of how this young Muslim man couldn&#39;t live
with being Muslim and being gay;
											he felt that the only option he had
was to die by suicide.
											We were all crying in the mosque,
I think, by that point.
											We were all mourning for this young
Muslim man that we had never met
											and now that we would never
get the chance to meet.
											You know, when I left
religious education at 16,
											I swore that I was done with religion
and I was never going back to it.
											I was never going to have another
conversation that I could not help
											with another person of faith again.
											When I was in that mosque that day

											and I was there to learn
about American values,
											I ended up getting schooled
on my own culture by a Muslim.
											Because I realised that I couldn&#39;t
run away from religion anymore.
											Within the LGBT community,
we have a saying that we tell people.
											We tell them that &#39;It Gets Better&#39;.
											What I realised that day
was that it gets better for some of us;
											it gets better for those of us who live
long enough to see it get better.
											I realised that I couldn&#39;t run away
from religion anymore,
											because religion shapes
how LGBT people are treated in the world.
											It shapes the laws
and how they treat LGBT people,
											which we can see from the lack
of equal marriage in this country.
											And it shapes how we, LGBT people,
feel about ourselves.
											The first lesson I learned
about being gay was that it was evil
											and that I was going to hell for it.
											I learned that from the Bible.
											There were times I would cry
in my bedroom as a teenager,
											bargaining with God,
asking him not to send me to hell,
											because I was so convinced
that I was going there.
											This text, this Bible, I know
for so many people it offers them hope,
											it offers them salvation, but for me
it offered a prison sentence.
											I think it&#39;s the same for a lot
of other LGBT young people.
											LGBT suicide rates are through the roof.
											This is the percentage of trans youth
alone in the UK who have attempted suicide
											over the course of the last year.
											We see these numbers play out
in Northern Ireland locally,
											and we know this
from trans youth services,
											who say they see it play out
among their young people.
											What do we do about this?
											I feel the only answer
is to change religious teaching
											of homosexuality and LGBT issues.
											I don&#39;t mean we berate
Christians and shout at them
											or berate Muslims and shout at them.
											We need to do the one thing that I didn&#39;t
want to do when I left school at 16:
											we need to have conversations,
difficult conversations,
											and fight for the hearts and minds
of those who oppose us.
											I&#39;ve studied this, and when you ask
people like Megan Phelps-Roper,
											who was a member of
the Westboro Baptist Church,
											a hate group in America,
											when you ask people like this,
when you ask former neo-Nazis,
											the most extreme people,
											when you ask, &quot;What changed your mind?
What made you abandon your views?&quot;
											they&#39;ll tell you the same thing:
It was a conversation.
											Someone who they were opposed to
struck up a conversation,
											and they learned that that person
was not who they thought they were,
											and they got to a point where they could
no longer hold those views.
											People tell me this isn&#39;t going to happen;
											there&#39;s no way the churches
will change their teachings
											or the mosques
will change their teachings.
											&quot;You&#39;re mad.&quot;
											And I would have agreed with them.
											But six weeks ago,
I was out in a gay bar -
											not this one -
											with my friend Jordan.
											He&#39;s from a Free Prebystarian
DUP-voting family,
											from &quot;County LegenDerry.&quot;
											I avoid that Londonderry-Derry thing,
											I hate that.
											We were out there with his mum,
											who is a Scottish Free-P
who goes to church every Sunday,
											and she was out in this bar,
supporting her gay son,
											just like Brenda Marquez McCool
											was out in Pulse that night
supporting her gay son.
											Don&#39;t tell me there&#39;s no hope
											because for too many LGBT young people,
											that is the only thing they have
that keeps them living.
											And by the way, that Free Presbytarian
mother went into work the next day
											and told everyone about this amazing thing
she&#39;d been to called a &#39;drag show&#39;.
											(Laughter)
											Now if you had told me
that I&#39;d be sitting in a gay bar
											with one of Ian Paisley&#39;s disciples
drinking cocktails, watching a drag show,
											I&#39;d have told you you were mad.
											(Laughter)
											What can you do?
											If you thought you were here
to passively listen to me rant on:
											No, I&#39;ve got a job for you all.
											If any of you are uncomfortable
with the thought of someone like me,
											please come up to me
after this event and talk to me.
											I won&#39;t bite your head off, 
I won&#39;t call you a homophobe.
											We&#39;ll just have a conversation,
											and I&#39;ll show you
that I&#39;m human just like you.
											If you are comfortable
with the thought of someone like me,
											have a conversation
with someone who isn&#39;t
											and try to change their mind.
											Because you could be saving a life.
											Finally, I&#39;d like to send a message
to all LGBT young people
											that are currently struggling,
especially those from faith backgrounds.
											&quot;For I know the plans
I have for you,&quot; declares the Lord,
											&quot;plans to prosper you and not to harm you,
plans to give you hope and a future.&quot;
											Jeremiah 29:11
											This talk is in memory of the Pulse 49
and all LGBT people who died by suicide.
											Thank you very much, folks.
											(Applause) (Cheers)
