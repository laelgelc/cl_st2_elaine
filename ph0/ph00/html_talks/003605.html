											I just did something I&#39;ve never done before.
											I spent a week at sea on a research vessel.
											Now I&#39;m not a scientist,
											but I was accompanying a remarkable scientific team
											from the University of South Florida
											who have been tracking the travels of BP&#39;s oil
											in the Gulf of Mexico.
											This is the boat we were on, by the way.
											The scientists I was with
											were not studying the effect of the oil and dispersants on the big stuff —
											the birds, the turtles,
											the dolphins, the glamorous stuff.
											They&#39;re looking at the really little stuff
											that gets eaten by the slightly less little stuff
											that eventually gets eaten by the big stuff.
											And what they&#39;re finding
											is that even trace amounts of oil and dispersants
											can be highly toxic to phytoplankton,
											which is very bad news,
											because so much life depends on it.
											So contrary to what we heard a few months back
											about how 75 percent of that oil
											sort of magically disappeared
											and we didn&#39;t have to worry about it,
											this disaster is still unfolding.
											It&#39;s still working its way up the food chain.
											Now this shouldn&#39;t come as a surprise to us.
											Rachel Carson —
											the godmother of modern environmentalism —
											warned us about this very thing
											back in 1962.
											She pointed out that the &quot;control men&quot; —
											as she called them —
											who carpet-bombed towns and fields
											with toxic insecticides like DDT,
											were only trying to kill the little stuff, the insects,
											not the birds.
											But they forgot this:
											the fact that birds dine on grubs,
											that robins eat lots of worms
											now saturated with DDT.
											And so, robin eggs failed to hatch,
											songbirds died en masse,
											towns fell silent.
											Thus the title &quot;Silent Spring.&quot;
											I&#39;ve been trying to pinpoint
											what keeps drawing me back to the Gulf of Mexico,
											because I&#39;m Canadian,
											and I can draw no ancestral ties.
											And I think what it is
											is I don&#39;t think we have fully come to terms
											with the meaning of this disaster,
											with what it meant to witness a hole
											ripped in our world,
											with what it meant to watch the contents of the Earth
											gush forth on live TV,
											24 hours a day,
											for months.
											After telling ourselves for so long
											that our tools and technology can control nature,
											suddenly we were face-to-face
											with our weakness,
											with our lack of control,
											as the oil burst out
											of every attempt to contain it —
											&quot;top hats,&quot; &quot;top kills&quot;
											and, most memorably, the &quot;junk shot&quot; —
											the bright idea
											of firing old tires and golf balls
											down that hole in the world.
											But even more striking
											than the ferocious power emanating from that well
											was the recklessness
											with which that power was unleashed —
											the carelessness, the lack of planning
											that characterized the operation
											from drilling to clean-up.
											If there is one thing
											BP&#39;s watery improv act made clear,
											it is that, as a culture,
											we have become far too willing to gamble
											with things that are precious
											and irreplaceable,
											and to do so without a back-up plan,
											without an exit strategy.
											And BP was hardly
											our first experience of this in recent years.
											Our leaders barrel into wars,
											telling themselves happy stories
											about cakewalks and welcome parades.
											Then, it is years of deadly damage control,
											Frankensteins of sieges and surges
											and counter-insurgencies,
											and once again, no exit strategy.
											Our financial wizards routinely fall victim
											to similar overconfidence,
											convincing themselves that the latest bubble
											is a new kind of market —
											the kind that never goes down.
											And when it inevitably does,
											the best and the brightest
											reach for the financial equivalent of the junk shot —
											in this case, throwing massive amounts
											of much-needed public money
											down a very different kind of hole.
											As with BP, the hole does get plugged,
											at least temporarily,
											but not before
											exacting a tremendous price.
											We have to figure out
											why we keep letting this happen,
											because we are in the midst
											of what may be our highest-stakes gamble of all —
											deciding what to do, or not to do,
											about climate change.
											Now as you know,
											a great deal of time is spent,
											in this country and around the world,
											inside the climate debate,
											on the question of, &quot;What if the IPC scientists
											are all wrong?&quot;
											Now a far more relevant question —
											as MIT physicist Evelyn Fox Keller puts it —
											is, &quot;What if those scientists are right?&quot;
											Given the stakes, the climate crisis
											clearly calls for us to act
											based on the precautionary principle —
											the theory that holds
											that when human health and the environment
											are significantly at risk
											and when the potential damage is irreversible,
											we cannot afford to wait
											for perfect scientific certainty.
											Better to err on the side of caution.
											More overt, the burden of proving
											that a practice is safe
											should not be placed on the public that would be harmed,
											but rather on the industry that stands to profit.
											But climate policy in the wealthy world —
											to the extent that such a thing exists —
											is not based on precaution,
											but rather on cost-benefit analysis —
											finding the course of action that economists believe
											will have the least impact
											on our GDP.
											So rather than asking, as precaution would demand,
											what can we do as quickly as possible
											to avoid potential catastrophe,
											we ask bizarre questions like this:
											&quot;What is the latest possible moment we can wait
											before we begin seriously lowering emissions?
											Can we put this off till 2020,
											2030, 2050?&quot;
											Or we ask,
											&quot;How much hotter can we let the planet get
											and still survive?
											Can we go with two degrees, three degrees, or —
											where we&#39;re currently going —
											four degrees Celsius?&quot;
											And by the way,
											the assumption that we can safely control
											the Earth&#39;s awesomely complex climate system
											as if it had a thermostat,
											making the planet not too hot, not too cold,
											but just right — sort of Goldilocks style —
											this is pure fantasy,
											and it&#39;s not coming from the climate scientists.
											It&#39;s coming from the economists
											imposing their mechanistic thinking
											on the science.
											The fact is that we simply don&#39;t know
											when the warming that we create
											will be utterly overwhelmed
											by feedback loops.
											So once again,
											why do we take these crazy risks
											with the precious?
											A range of explanations
											may be popping into your mind by now,
											like &quot;greed.&quot;
											This is a popular explanation, and there&#39;s lots of truth to it,
											because taking big risks, as we all know,
											pays a lot of money.
											Another explanation that you often hear for recklessness
											is hubris.
											And greed and hubris
											are intimately intertwined
											when it comes to recklessness.
											For instance, if you happen to be a 35-year-old banker
											taking home 100 times more
											than a brain surgeon,
											then you need a narrative,
											you need a story
											that makes that disparity okay.
											And you actually don&#39;t have a lot of options.
											You&#39;re either an incredibly good scammer,
											and you&#39;re getting away with it — you gamed the system —
											or you&#39;re some kind of boy genius,
											the likes of which the world has never seen.
											Now both of these options — the boy genius and the scammer —
											are going to make you vastly overconfident
											and therefore more prone
											to taking even bigger risks in the future.
											By the way, Tony Hayward, the former CEO of BP,
											had a plaque on his desk
											inscribed with this inspirational slogan:
											&quot;What would you attempt to do
											if you knew you could not fail?&quot;
											Now this is actually a popular plaque,
											and this is a crowd of overachievers,
											so I&#39;m betting that some of you have this plaque.
											Don&#39;t feel ashamed.
											Putting fear of failure out of your mind
											can be a very good thing
											if you&#39;re training for a triathlon
											or preparing to give a TEDTalk,
											but personally, I think people with the power
											to detonate our economy and ravage our ecology
											would do better having
											a picture of Icarus hanging from the wall,
											because — maybe not that one in particular —
											but I want them thinking about the possibility of failure
											all of the time.
											So we have greed,
											we&#39;ve got overconfidence/hubris,
											but since we&#39;re here at TEDWomen,
											let&#39;s consider one other factor
											that could be contributing in some small way
											to societal recklessness.
											Now I&#39;m not going to belabor this point,
											but studies do show that, as investors,
											women are much less prone
											to taking reckless risks than men,
											precisely because, as we&#39;ve already heard,
											women tend not to suffer from overconfidence
											in the same way that men do.
											So it turns out
											that being paid less and praised less
											has its upsides —
											for society at least.
											The flipside of this
											is that constantly being told
											that you are gifted, chosen
											and born to rule
											has distinct societal downsides.
											And this problem — call it the &quot;perils of privilege&quot; —
											brings us closer, I think,
											to the root of our collective recklessness.
											Because none of us — at least in the global North —
											neither men nor women,
											are fully exempt from this message.
											Here&#39;s what I&#39;m talking about.
											Whether we actively believe them
											or consciously reject them,
											our culture remains in the grips
											of certain archetypal stories
											about our supremacy
											over others and over nature —
											the narrative of the newly discovered frontier
											and the conquering pioneer,
											the narrative of manifest destiny,
											the narrative of apocalypse and salvation.
											And just when you think these stories are fading into history,
											and that we&#39;ve gotten over them,
											they pop up in the strangest places.
											For instance, I stumbled across this advertisement
											outside the women&#39;s washroom
											in the Kansas City airport.
											It&#39;s for Motorola&#39;s new Rugged cell phone,
											and yes, it really does say,
											&quot;Slap Mother Nature in the face.&quot;
											And I&#39;m not just showing it to pick on Motorola —
											that&#39;s just a bonus.
											I&#39;m showing it because —
											they&#39;re not a sponsor, are they? —
											because, in its own way,
											this is a crass version
											of our founding story.
											We slapped Mother Nature around and won,
											and we always win,
											because dominating nature is our destiny.
											But this is not the only fairytale we tell ourselves about nature.
											There&#39;s another one, equally important,
											about how that very same Mother Nature
											is so nurturing and so resilient
											that we can never make a dent in her abundance.
											Let&#39;s hear from Tony Hayward again.
											&quot;The Gulf of Mexico is a very big ocean.
											The amount of oil and dispersants that we are putting into it
											is tiny in relation to the total water volume.&quot;
											In other words, the ocean is big;
											she can take it.
											It is this underlying assumption of limitlessness
											that makes it possible
											to take the reckless risks that we do.
											Because this is our real master-narrative:
											however much we mess up,
											there will always be more —
											more water, more land,
											more untapped resources.
											A new bubble will replace the old one.
											A new technology will come along
											to fix the messes we made with the last one.
											In a way, that is the story
											of the settling of the Americas,
											the supposedly inexhaustible frontier
											to which Europeans escaped.
											And it&#39;s also the story of modern capitalism,
											because it was the wealth from this land
											that gave birth to our economic system,
											one that cannot survive without perpetual growth
											and an unending supply
											of new frontiers.
											Now the problem is
											that the story was always a lie.
											The Earth always did have limits.
											They were just beyond our sights.
											And now we are hitting those limits
											on multiple fronts.
											I believe that we know this,
											yet we find ourselves trapped in a kind of narrative loop.
											Not only do we continue to tell and retell
											the same tired stories,
											but we are now doing so
											with a frenzy and a fury
											that, frankly, verges on camp.
											How else to explain the cultural space
											occupied by Sarah Palin?
											Now on the one hand,
											exhorting us to &quot;drill, baby, drill,&quot;
											because God put those resources into the ground
											in order for us to exploit them,
											and on the other, glorying in the wilderness
											of Alaska&#39;s untouched beauty
											on her hit reality TV show.
											The twin message is as comforting as it is mad.
											Ignore those creeping fears
											that we have finally hit the wall.
											There are still no limits.
											There will always be another frontier.
											So stop worrying and keep shopping.
											Now, would that this were just about
											Sarah Palin and her reality TV show.
											In environmental circles,
											we often hear that, rather than shifting to renewables,
											we are continuing with business as usual.
											This assessment, unfortunately,
											is far too optimistic.
											The truth is that we have already exhausted
											so much of the easily accessible fossil fuels
											that we have already entered
											a far riskier business era,
											the era of extreme energy.
											So that means drilling for oil in the deepest water,
											including the icy Arctic seas,
											where a clean-up may simply be impossible.
											It means large-scale hydraulic fracking for gas
											and massive strip-mining operations for coal,
											the likes of which we haven&#39;t yet seen.
											And most controversially, it means the tar sands.
											I&#39;m always surprised by how little
											people outside of Canada
											know about the Alberta Tar Sands,
											which this year are projected to become
											the number one source of imported oil
											to the United States.
											It&#39;s worth taking a moment to understand this practice,
											because I believe it speaks to recklessness
											and the path we&#39;re on
											like little else.
											So this is where the tar sands live,
											under one of the last magnificent
											Boreal forests.
											The oil is not liquid.
											You can&#39;t just drill a hole and pump it out.
											Tar sand&#39;s oil is solid,
											mixed in with the soil.
											So to get at it,
											you first have to get rid of the trees.
											Then, you rip off the topsoil
											and get at that oily sand.
											The process requires a huge amount of water,
											which is then pumped into massive toxic tailing ponds.
											That&#39;s very bad news for local indigenous people
											living downstream
											who are reporting alarmingly high cancer rates.
											Now looking at these images,
											it&#39;s difficult to grasp the scale of this operation,
											which can already be seen from space
											and could grow to an area the size of England.
											I find it helps actually
											to look at the dump trucks that move the earth,
											the largest ever built.
											That&#39;s a person down there by the wheel.
											My point is that
											this is not oil drilling.
											It&#39;s not even mining.
											It is terrestrial skinning.
											Vast, vivid landscapes
											are being gutted,
											left monochromatic gray.
											Now I should confess that as [far as] I&#39;m concerned
											this would be an abomination
											if it emitted not one particle of carbon.
											But the truth is that, on average,
											turning that gunk into crude oil
											produces about three times more greenhouse gas pollution
											than it does to produce conventional oil
											in Canada.
											How else to describe this,
											but as a form of mass insanity?
											Just when we know we need to be learning
											to live on the surface of our planet,
											off the power of sun, wind and waves,
											we are frantically digging
											to get at the dirtiest,
											highest-emitting stuff imaginable.
											This is where our story of endless growth
											has taken us,
											to this black hole at the center of my country —
											a place of such planetary pain
											that, like the BP gusher,
											one can only stand to look at it for so long.
											As Jared Diamond and others have shown us,
											this is how civilizations commit suicide,
											by slamming their foot on the accelerator
											at the exact moment
											when they should be putting on the brakes.
											The problem is that our master-narrative
											has an answer for that too.
											At the very last minute, we are going to get saved
											just like in every Hollywood movie,
											just like in the Rapture.
											But, of course, our secular religion is technology.
											Now, you may have noticed
											more and more headlines like these.
											The idea behind this form of &quot;geoengineering&quot; as it&#39;s called,
											is that, as the planet heats up,
											we may be able to shoot sulfates and aluminum particles
											into the stratosphere
											to reflect some of the sun&#39;s rays
											back to space,
											thereby cooling the planet.
											The wackiest plan — and I&#39;m not making this up —
											would put what is essentially a garden hose
											18-and-a-half miles high into the sky,
											suspended by balloons,
											to spew sulfur dioxide.
											So, solving the problem of pollution with more pollution.
											Think of it as the ultimate junk shot.
											The serious scientists involved in this research
											all stress that these techniques
											are entirely untested.
											They don&#39;t know if they&#39;ll work,
											and they have no idea
											what kind of terrifying side effects they could unleash.
											Nevertheless, the mere mention of geoengineering
											is being greeted in some circles,
											particularly media circles,
											with a relief tinged with euphoria.
											An escape hatch has been reached.
											A new frontier has been found.
											Most importantly,
											we don&#39;t have to change our lifestyles after all.
											You see, for some people,
											their savior is a guy in a flowing robe.
											For other people, it&#39;s a guy with a garden hose.
											We badly need some new stories.
											We need stories that have different kinds of heroes
											willing to take different kinds of risks —
											risks that confront recklessness head on,
											that put the precautionary principle into practice,
											even if that means through direct action —
											like hundreds of young people willing to get arrested,
											blocking dirty power plants
											or fighting mountaintop-removal coal mining.
											We need stories
											that replace that linear narrative of endless growth
											with circular narratives
											that remind us
											that what goes around comes around.
											That this is our only home.
											There is no escape hatch.
											Call it karma, call it physics,
											action and reaction, call it precaution —
											the principle that reminds us
											that life is too precious to be risked
											for any profit.
											Thank you.
											(Applause)
