											What we&#39;re really here to talk about is the &quot;how.&quot;
											Okay, so how exactly do we create this
											world-shattering, if you will, innovation?
											Now, I want to tell you a quick story.
											We&#39;ll go back a little more than a year.
											In fact, the date — I&#39;m curious to know
											if any of you know what happened on this momentous date?
											It was February 3rd, 2008.
											Anyone remember what happened,
											February 3rd, 2008?
											Super Bowl. I heard it over here. It was the date of the Super Bowl.

								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And the reason that this date was so momentous
											is that what my colleagues, John King
											and Halee Fischer-Wright, and I noticed
											as we began to debrief various Super Bowl parties,
											is that it seemed to us
											that across the United States,
											if you will, tribal councils had convened.
											And they had discussed things of great national importance.
											Like, &quot;Do we like the Budweiser commercial?&quot;
											and, &quot;Do we like the nachos?&quot; and, &quot;Who is going to win?&quot;
											But they also talked about which candidate they were going to support.
									</p>

									<p>
											And if you go back in time to February 3rd,
											it looked like Hilary Clinton was going to get the Democratic nomination.
											And there were even some polls that were saying she was going to go all the way.
											But when we talked to people,
											it appeared that a funnel effect had happened
											in these tribes all across the United States.
											Now what is a tribe? A tribe is a group of
											about 20 — so kind of more than a team —
											20 to about 150 people.
											And it&#39;s within these tribes that all of our work gets done.
											But not just work. It&#39;s within these tribes
											that societies get built,
											that important things happen.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And so as we surveyed the, if you will, representatives
											from various tribal councils that met,
											also known as Super Bowl parties,
											we sent the following email off to 40 newspaper editors the following day.
											February 4th, we posted it on our website. This was before Super Tuesday.
											We said, &quot;The tribes that we&#39;re in
											are saying it&#39;s going to be Obama.&quot;
											Now, the reason we knew that
											was because we spent the previous 10 years
											studying tribes, studying these naturally occurring groups.

											All of you are members of tribes.
											In walking around at the break,
											many of you had met members of your tribe. And you were talking to them.
											And many of you were doing what great, if you will, tribal leaders do,
											which is to find someone
											who is a member of a tribe,
											and to find someone else who is another member of a different tribe,
											and make introductions.
											That is in fact what great tribal leaders do.

											So here is the bottom line.
											If you focus in on a group like this —
											this happens to be a USC game —
											and you zoom in with one of those super satellite cameras
											and do magnification factors so you could see individual people,
											you would in fact see not a single crowd,
											just like there is not a single crowd here,
											but you would see these tribes that are then coming together.
											And from a distance it appears that it&#39;s a single group.
											And so people form tribes.
											They always have. They always will.
											Just as fish swim and birds fly,
											people form tribes. It&#39;s just what we do.
											But here&#39;s the rub.
											Not all tribes are the same,
											and what makes the difference is the culture.

									<p>
											Now here is the net out of this.
											You&#39;re all a member of tribes.
											If you can find a way to take the tribes that you&#39;re in
											and nudge them forward,
											along these tribal stages
											to what we call Stage Five, which is the top of the mountain.
											But we&#39;re going to start with what we call Stage One.
											Now, this is the lowest of the stages.
											You don&#39;t want this. Okay?
											This is a bit of a difficult image to put up on the screen.
											But it&#39;s one that I think we need to learn from.

											Stage One produces people
											who do horrible things.
											This is the kid who shot up Virginia Tech.
											Stage One is a group where people
											systematically sever relationships from functional tribes,
											and then pool together
											with people who think like they do.
											Stage One is literally the culture of gangs
											and it is the culture of prisons.
											Now, again, we don&#39;t often deal with Stage One.
											And I want to make the point
											that as members of society, we need to.
											It&#39;s not enough to simply write people off.

									<p>
											But let&#39;s move on to Stage Two.
											Now, Stage One, you&#39;ll notice, says, in effect, &quot;Life Sucks.&quot;
											So, this other book that Steve mentioned,
											that just came out, called &quot;The Three Laws of Performance,&quot;
											my colleague, Steve Zaffron and I,
											argue that as people see the world, so they behave.
											Well, if people see the world in such a way that life sucks,
											then their behavior will follow automatically from that.
											It will be despairing hostility.
											They&#39;ll do whatever it takes to survive,
											even if that means undermining other people.

											Now, my birthday is coming up shortly,
											and my driver&#39;s license expires.
											And the reason that that&#39;s relevant is that very soon
											I will be walking into what we call
											a Stage Two tribe,
											which looks like this.
											(Laughter)
											Now, am I saying that in every Department of Motor Vehicles
											across the land, you find a Stage Two culture?
											No. But in the one near me,
											where I have to go in just a few days,
											what I will say when I&#39;m standing in line is,
											&quot;How can people be so dumb, and yet live?&quot;

									<p>
											Now, am I saying that there are dumb people working here?
											Actually, no, I&#39;m not.
											But I&#39;m saying the culture makes people dumb.
											So in a Stage Two culture —
											and we find these in all sorts of different places —
											you find them, in fact, in the best organizations in the world.
											You find them in all places in society.
											I&#39;ve come across them at the organizations
											that everybody raves about as being best in class.
											But here is the point. If you believe and you say
											to people in your tribe, in effect,
											&quot;My life sucks.
											I mean, if I got to go to TEDx USC
											my life wouldn&#39;t suck. But I don&#39;t. So it does.&quot;
											If that&#39;s how you talked, imagine what kind of work would get done.
											What kind of innovation would get done?
											The amount of world-changing behavior that would happen?
											In fact it would be basically nil.

											Now when we go on to Stage Three: this is the one
											that hits closest to home for many of us.
											Because it is in Stage Three that many of us move.
											And we park. And we stay.
											Stage Three says, &quot;I&#39;m great. And you&#39;re not.&quot;
											(Laughter)
											I&#39;m great and you&#39;re not.
											Now imagine having a whole room of people
											saying, in effect, &quot;I&#39;m great and you&#39;re not.&quot;
											Or, &quot;I&#39;m going to find some way to compete with you
											and come out on top as a result of that.&quot;

											I know this sounds like a joke. Three doctors walk into a bar.

											I happened to be in the elevator collecting data for this book.

											The next one got kind of a wry smile on his face and said,

											Here is the greatest challenge we face in innovation.
											It is moving from Stage Three
											to Stage Four.
											Let&#39;s take a look at a quick video snippet.
											This is from a company called Zappos, located outside Las Vegas.
											And my question on the other side is just going to be,
											&quot;What do you think they value?&quot;
											It was not Christmas time. There was a Christmas tree.
											This is their lobby.
											Employees volunteer time in the advice booth.
											Notice it looks like something out of a Peanuts cartoon.

								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Okay, we&#39;re going through the hallway here at Zappos.
											This is a call center. Notice how it&#39;s decorated.
											Notice people are applauding for us.
											They don&#39;t know who we are and they don&#39;t care. And if they did
											they probably wouldn&#39;t applaud.
											But you&#39;ll notice the level of excitement.
											Notice, again, how they decorate their office.
											Now, what&#39;s important to people at Zappos,
											these may not be the things that are important to you.
											But they value things like fun. And they value creativity.
											One of their stated values is, &quot;Be a little bit weird.&quot;
											And you&#39;ll notice they are a little bit weird.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So when individuals come together
											and find something that unites them
											that&#39;s greater than their individual competence,
											then something very important happens.
											The group gels. And it changes
											from a group of highly motivated
											but fairly individually-centric people
											into something larger,
											into a tribe that becomes aware of its own existence.
											Stage Four tribes can do remarkable things.
											But you&#39;ll notice we&#39;re not at the top of the mountain yet.
											There is, in fact, another stage.

											Now, some of you may not recognize the scene that&#39;s up here.
											And if you take a look at the headline of Stage Five, which is &quot;Life is Great,&quot;
											this may seem a little incongruous.
											This is a scene or snippet
											from the Truth and Reconciliation process in South Africa
											for which Desmond Tutu won the Nobel Prize.
											Now think about that. South Africa,
											terrible atrocities had happened in the society.
											And people came together
											focused only on those two values: truth and reconciliation.
											There was no road map. No one had ever done
											anything like this before.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And in this atmosphere, where the only guidance
											was people&#39;s values and their noble cause,
											what this group accomplished was historic.
											And people, at the time, feared that South Africa
											would end up going the way that Rwanda has gone,
											descending into one skirmish after another
											in a civil war that seems to have no end.
											In fact, South Africa has not gone down that road.
											Largely because people like Desmond Tutu
											set up a Stage Five process
											to involve the thousands and perhaps millions
											of tribes in the country, to bring everyone together.
											So, people hear this and they conclude the following,
											as did we in doing the study.

											I don&#39;t want to talk like they do
											at the particular DMV that&#39;s close to where Dave lives.
											I really don&#39;t want to just say &quot;I&#39;m great,&quot;
											because that kind of sounds narcissistic, and then I won&#39;t have any friends.
											Saying, &quot;We&#39;re great&quot; — that sounds pretty good.

											the phrase that sticks in many of our minds
											is things about inalienable rights.
											I mean, that&#39;s Stage Five, right? Life is great,
											oriented only by our values,
											no other guidance.
											In fact, most of the document is written at Stage Two.

											What about Martin Luther King?

											Just one little bit of happiness and joy after another.
											In fact, Martin Luther King&#39;s most famous line was at Stage Three.
											He didn&#39;t say &quot;We have a dream.&quot; He said, &quot;I have a dream.&quot;

											say, &quot;I&#39;m great and you&#39;re not.&quot;

											So the first little finding from this

											Tribes can only hear one level above and below where they are.

											But we&#39;re not done yet. Because then how do we go from Stage Four,
											which is great, to Stage Five?
											The story that I like to end with is this. It comes out of
											a place called the Gallup Organization.
											You know they do polls, right?
											So it&#39;s Stage Four. We&#39;re great. Who is not great?
											Pretty much everybody else who does polls.
											If Gallup releases a poll on the same day that NBC releases a poll,
											people will pay attention to the Gallup poll. Okay, we understand that.
											So, they were bored.
											They wanted to change the world. So here is the question someone asked.

									<p>
											&quot;How could we,
											instead of just polling what Asia thinks
											or what the United States thinks,
											or who thinks what about Obama
											versus McCain or something like that,
											what does the entire world think?&quot;
											And they found a way to do the first-ever world poll.
											They had people involved who were Nobel laureates
											in economics, who reported being bored.
											And suddenly they pulled out sheets of paper
											and were trying to figure out, &quot;How do we survey the population
											of Sub-Saharan Africa?
											How do we survey populations that don&#39;t have access to technology,
											and speak languages we don&#39;t speak,
											and we don&#39;t know anyone who speaks those languages. Because in order
											to achieve on this great mission,
											we have to be able to do it.
											Incidentally, they did pull it off.
											And they released the first-ever world poll.

									<p>
											So I&#39;d like to leave you with these thoughts.
											First of all: we all form tribes, all of us.
											You&#39;re in tribes here. Hopefully you&#39;re extending the reach
											of the tribes that you have.
											But the question on the table is this:
											What kind of an impact are the tribes
											that you are in making?
											You&#39;re hearing one presentation after another,
											often representing a group of people, a tribe,
											about how they have changed the world.
											If you do what we&#39;ve talked about, you listen
											for how people actually communicate in the tribes that you&#39;re in.
											And you don&#39;t leave them where they are. You nudge them forward.
											You remember to talk all five culture stages.
											Because we&#39;ve got people in all five, around us.
											And the question that I&#39;d like to leave you with is this:
											Will your tribes change the world?
											Thank you very much.
											(Applause)
