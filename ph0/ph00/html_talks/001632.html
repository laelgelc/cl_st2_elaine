<meta content='An interview with the founders of Black Lives Matter' itemprop='name'>
<meta content='Born out of a social media post, the Black Lives Matter movement has sparked discussion about race and inequality across the world. In this spirited conversation with Mia Birdsong, the movement&#x0027;s three founders share what they&#x0027;ve learned about leadership and what provides them with hope and inspiration in the face of painful realities. Their advice on how to participate in ensuring freedom for everybody: join something, start something and "sharpen each other, so that we all can rise."' itemprop='description'>

											We need this because the global reality
											is that black people
are subject to all sorts of disparities
											in most of our most challenging

											I think about issues like climate change,
											and how six of the 10 worst impacted
nations by climate change
											are actually on the continent of Africa.
											People are reeling
from all sorts of unnatural disasters,
											displacing them
from their ancestral homes

											We also see disasters
like Hurricane Matthew,
											which recently wreaked havoc
in many different nations,
											but caused the most damage to Haiti.
											Haiti is the poorest country
in this hemisphere,
											and its inhabitants are black people.
											And what we&#39;re seeing in Haiti
											is that they were actually facing
a number of challenges
											that even preceded this hurricane.
											They were reeling from the earthquake,
											they were reeling from cholera
that was brought in by UN peacekeepers
											and still hasn&#39;t been eradicated.
											This is unconscionable.
											And this would not happen if this nation
didn&#39;t have a population that was black,

											Alicia Garza: Sure.
											So I think race and racism
is probably the most studied
											social, economic and political
phenomenon in this country,
											but it&#39;s also the least understood.
											The reality is that race
in the United States
											operates on a spectrum
from black to white.
											Doesn&#39;t mean that people who are
in between don&#39;t experience racism,
											but it means that the closer
you are to white on that spectrum,
											the better off you are.
											And the closer to black
that you are on that spectrum
											the worse off your are.
											When we think about
how we address problems in this country,
											we often start from a place
of trickle-down justice.
											So using white folks
as the control we say,
											well, if we make things
better for white folks
											then everybody else is going to get free.
											But actually it doesn&#39;t work that way.
											We have to address problems at the root,
											and when you deal with what&#39;s
happening in black communities,
											it creates an effervescence, right?
											So a bubble up rather than a trickle down.
											Let me give an example.
											When we talk about the wage gap,
											we often say women make 78 cents
to every dollar that a man makes.
											You all have heard that before.
											But those are the statistics
for white women and white men.
											The reality is that black women
make something like 64 cents
											to every 78 cents that white women make.
											When we talk about latinas,
it goes down to about 58 cents.
											If we were to talk about indigenous women,
											if we were to talk about trans women,
											it would even go further down.
											So again,
											if you deal with those
who are the most impacted,
											everybody has an opportunity
to benefit from that,
											rather than dealing with the folks
who are not as impacted,
											and expecting it to trickle down.

											What we&#39;ve seen is thousands
of black people showing up for our lives

											I think our work as movement leaders
isn&#39;t just about our own visibility
											but rather how do we
make the whole visible.
											How do we not just fight
for our individual selves
											but fight for everybody?
											And I also think
											leadership looks like
everybody in this audience
											showing up for black lives.
											It&#39;s not just about coming
and watching people on a stage, right?
											It&#39;s about how do you
become that leader —
											whether it&#39;s in your workplace,
whether it&#39;s in your home —
											and believe that the movement
for black lives isn&#39;t just for us,

											OT: So I&#39;ve been learning
a great deal about interdependence.
											I&#39;ve been learning
about how to trust your team.
											I&#39;ve come up with this new mantra
											after coming back
from a three-month sabbatical,
											which is rare for black women to take
who are in leadership,
											but I felt it was really important
for my leadership and for my team
											to also practice stepping back
											as well as also sometimes stepping in.
											And what I learned in this process
was that we need to acknowledge
											that different people
contribute different strengths,
											and that in order
for our entire team to flourish,
											we have to allow them
to share and allow them to shine.
											And so during my sabbatical
											with the organization
that I also work with,
											I saw our team rise up in my absence.
											They were able to launch new programs,
											fundraise.
											And when I came back,
											I had to give them
a lot of gratitude and praise
											because they showed me
that they truly had my back
											and that they truly had their own backs.

									<p>
											You know, in this process
of my sabbatical,
											I was really reminded
											of this Southern African
philosophy of Ubuntu.
											I am because you are;
											you are because I am.
											And I realized that my own leadership,
											and the contributions
that I&#39;m able to make,
											is in large part due to the contributions
that they make, right?
											And I have to acknowledge that,
and I have to see that,
											and so my new mantra is,
&quot;Keep calm and trust the team.&quot;
											And also,
											&quot;Keep calm and thank the team.&quot;

											MB: You know, one of the things
I feel like I&#39;ve heard
											in the context of the Black Lives Matter
movement more than anywhere else
											is about being a leaderful movement,

											that women often bring

											AG: Yeah ...
											How many of you heard that saying
that leadership is lonely?
											I think that there is an element
where leadership is lonely,
											but I also believe
that it doesn&#39;t have to be like that.
											And in order for us to get to that point,
											I think there&#39;s a few things
that we need to be doing.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So one is we have to stop
treating leaders like superheroes.
											We are ordinary people
attempting to do extraordinary things,
											and so we need to be
supported in that way.

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											The other thing that
I&#39;ve learned about leadership
											is that there&#39;s a difference
between leadership and celebrities, right?
											And there&#39;s a way in which we&#39;ve been
kind of transformed into celebrities
											rather than people
who are trying to solve a problem.
											And the way that we treat
celebrities is very fickle, right?
											We like them one day,
											we don&#39;t like what they&#39;re
wearing the next day,
											and all of a sudden we have issues, right?
											So we need to stop deifying leaders
											so that more people
will step into leadership.
											Lots of people are terrified
to step into leadership
											because of how much scrutiny they receive
											and how brutal we are with leaders.

									<p>
											And then the last thing
that I&#39;ve learned about leadership
											is that it&#39;s really easy to be a leader
when everybody likes you.
											But it&#39;s hard to be a leader
when you have to make hard choices
											and when you have to do what&#39;s right,
											even though people
are not going to like you for it.
											And so in that way,
											I think another way
that we can support leaders
											is to struggle with us,
											but struggle with us politically,
											not personally.
											We can have disagreements
without being disagreeable,
											but it&#39;s important for us
to sharpen each other,
											so that we all can rise.

											Immigrants all over the world
who are doing the best that they can
											to make a living,
to survive and also to thrive.
											Right now there are
over 244 million people
											who aren&#39;t living
in their country of origin.
											This is a 40 percent increase
since the year 2000.
											So what this tells me
											is that the disparities across the globe
are only getting worse.
											Yet there are people who are finding
the strength and wherewithal to travel,
											to move,
											to eke out a better living for themselves
											and to provide for their families
and their loved ones.
											And some of these people
who are immigrants
											are also undocumented.
											They&#39;re unauthorized.
											And they inspire me even more
											because although our society
is telling them, you&#39;re not wanted,
											you&#39;re not needed here,
											and they&#39;re highly vulnerable
and subject to abuse, to wage theft,
											to exploitation and xenophobic attacks,
											many of them are also beginning
to organize in their communities.
											And what I&#39;m seeing is
that there&#39;s also an emerging network
											of black, undocumented people
who are resisting the framework,
											and resisting the criminalization
of their existence.
											And that to me is incredibly powerful
											and inspires me every singe day.

											AG: So we know that young people
are the present and the future,
											but what inspires me are older people
											who are becoming transformed
in the service of this movement.
											We all know that as you get older,
											you get a little more
entrenched in your ways.
											It&#39;s happening to me, I know that&#39;s right.
											But I&#39;m so inspired when I see people
who have a way that they do things,
											have a way that they
think about the world,
											and they&#39;re courageous enough to be open
to listening to what the experiences are
											of so many of us who want
to live in world that&#39;s just
											and want to live
in a world that&#39;s equitable.
											And I&#39;m also inspired by the actions
that I&#39;m seeing older people taking
											in service of this movement.
											I&#39;m inspired by seeing older people
step into their own power and leadership
											and say, &quot;I&#39;m not passing a torch,
											I&#39;m helping you light the fire.&quot;

She is a co-founder of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://blacklivesmatter.com/about/\" target=\"_blank\">#BlackLivesMatter</a>. The historic political project was launched in the wake of the murder of Trayvon Martin in order to explicitly combat implicit bias and anti-black racism, and to protect and affirm the beauty and dignity of all black lives. Tometi is credited with creating the project&#39;s online platforms and initiating the social media strategy during its early days. The campaign has grown into a national network of approximately 50 chapters.</p><p>Tometi is currently at the helm of the country&#39;s leading black organization for immigrant rights, the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://blackalliance.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Black Alliance for Just Immigration</a>&nbsp;(BAJI). Founded in 2006, BAJI is a national organization that educates and advocates to further immigrant rights and racial justice together with African-American, Afro-Latino, African and Caribbean immigrant communities. As the executive director at BAJI, Tometi collaborates with staff and communities in Los Angeles, Phoenix, New York, Oakland, Washington, DC and communities throughout the southern states. The organization&#39;s most recent campaign helped win family reunification visas for Haitians displaced by the 2010 earthquake. BAJI is an award-winning institution with recognition by leading intuitions across the country.</p><p>A transnational feminist, Tometi supports and helps shape the strategic work of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/PanAfricanNetworkInDefenseOfMigrantsRightspaNidmr/\" target=\"_blank\">Pan African Network in Defense of Migrant Rights</a>, and the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://blackimmigration.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Black Immigration Network</a>&nbsp;international and national formations respectively, dedicated to people of African descent.

Her contributions include leading organizing efforts for the first ever black-led rally for immigrant justice and the first Congressional briefing on black immigrants in Washington, DC. Additionally, she coordinated BAJI&#39;s work as launch partner with Race Forward&#39;s historic &quot;Drop the I-Word&quot; campaign, working with the campaign to raise awareness about the importance of respectful language and history through the lens of the Great Migration, the Civil Rights Movement and current migration of the black diaspora. Tometi has been active in social movements for over a decade. She is a student of liberation theology and her practice is in the tradition of Ella Baker, informed by Stuart Hall, bell hooks and black Feminist thinkers. She was a lead architect of the Black-Brown Coalition of Arizona and was involved in grassroots organizing against SB 1070 with the Alto Arizona campaign. Tometi is a former case manager for survivors of domestic violence and still provides community education on the issue.</p><p>Tometi holds a Bachelor of Arts degree in history and a Masters of Arts degree in communication and advocacy.
