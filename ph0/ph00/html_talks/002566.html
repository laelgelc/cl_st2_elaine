<title>Yoruba Richen: What the gay rights movement learned from the civil rights movement | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: As a member of both the African American and LGBT communities, filmmaker Yoruba Richen is fascinated with the overlaps and tensions between the gay rights and the civil rights movements. She explores how the two struggles intertwine and propel each other forward — and, in an unmissable argument, she dispels a myth about their points of conflict. A powerful reminder that we all have a stake in equality." />

<meta content='As a member of both the African American and LGBT communities, filmmaker Yoruba Richen is fascinated with the overlaps and tensions between the gay rights and the civil rights movements. She explores how the two struggles intertwine and propel each other forward — and, in an unmissable argument, she dispels a myth about their points of conflict. A powerful reminder that we all have a stake in equality.' itemprop='description'>

											Election night 2008
											was a night that tore me in half.
											It was the night that Barack Obama was elected.
											[One hundred and forty-three] 
years after the end of slavery,
											and [43] years after the passage
											of the Voting Rights Act,
											an African-American was elected president.
											Many of us never thought that this was possible
											until the moment that it happened.
											And in many ways, it was the climax
											of the black civil rights movement
											in the United States.

									<p>
											I was in California that night,
											which was ground zero at the time
											for another movement:
											the marriage equality movement.
											Gay marriage was on the ballot
											in the form of Proposition 8,
											and as the election returns started to come in,
											it became clear that the right
											for same sex couples to marry,
											which had recently been granted
by the California courts,
											was going to be taken away.
											So on the same night
											that Barack Obama won his historic presidency,
											the lesbian and gay community suffered
											one of our most painful defeats.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And then it got even worse.
											Pretty much immediately,
											African-Americans started to be blamed
											for the passage of Proposition 8.
											This was largely due to an incorrect poll that said
											that blacks had voted for the measure
											by something like 70 percent.
											This turned out not to be true,
											but this idea of pervasive black homophobia set in,
											and was grabbed on by the media.
											I couldn&#39;t tear myself away from the coverage.
											I listened to some gay commentator say
											that the African-American community
											was notoriously homophobic,
											and now that civil rights had been achieved for us,
											we wanted to take away other people&#39;s rights.
											There were even reports of racist epithets
											being thrown at some of the participants
											of the gay rights rallies
											that took place after the election.
											And on the other side,
											some African-Americans dismissed or ignored
											homophobia that was indeed real in our community.
											And others resented this comparison
											between gay rights and civil rights,
											and once again, the sinking feeling
											that two minority groups
											of which I&#39;m both a part of
											were competing with each other
											instead of supporting each other
											overwhelmed and, frankly, pissed me off.

									<p>
											Now, I&#39;m a documentary filmmaker,
											so after going through my pissed off stage
											and yelling at the television and radio,
											my next instinct was
											to make a movie.
											And what guided me in making this film was,
											how was this happening?
											How was it that the gay rights movement
											was being pitted against the civil rights movement?
											And this wasn&#39;t just an abstract question.
											I&#39;m a beneficiary of both movements,
											so this was actually personal.
											But then something else happened
											after that election in 2008.
											The march towards gay equality
											accelerated at a pace
											that surprised and shocked everyone,
											and is still reshaping our laws and our policies,
											our institutions and our entire country.
											And so it started to become increasingly clear to me
											that this pitting of the two movements
											against each other actually didn&#39;t make sense,
											and that they were in fact
											much, much more interconnected,
											and that, in fact, some of the way
											that the gay rights movement has been able
											to make such incredible gains so quickly
											is that it&#39;s used some of the same tactics
											and strategies that were first laid down
											by the civil rights movement.
											Let&#39;s just look at a few of these strategies.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											First off, it&#39;s really interesting to see,
											to actually visually see, how quick
											the gay rights movement has made its gains,
											if you look at a few of the major events
											on a timeline of both freedom movements.
											Now, there are tons of milestones
											in the civil rights movement,
											but the first one we&#39;re going to start with
											is the 1955 Montgomery bus boycott.
											This was a protest campaign
											against Montgomery, Alabama&#39;s segregation
											on their public transit system,
											and it began when a woman named Rosa Parks
											refused to give up her seat to a white person.
											The campaign lasted a year,
											and it galvanized the civil rights movement
											like nothing had before it.
											And I call this strategy the
											&quot;I&#39;m tired of your foot on my neck&quot; strategy.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So gays and lesbians have been in society
											since societies began,
											but up until the mid-20th century,
											homosexual acts were still illegal in most states.
											So just 14 years after the Montgomery bus boycott,
											a group of LGBT folks took that same strategy.
											It&#39;s known as Stonewall, in 1969,
											and it&#39;s where a group of LGBT patrons
											fought back against police beatings
											at a Greenwich Village bar that sparked
											three days of rioting.
											Incidentally, black and latino LGBT folks
											were at the forefront of this rebellion,
											and it&#39;s a really interesting example
											of the intersection of our struggles against racism,
											homophobia, gender identity and police brutality.
											After Stonewall happened, gay liberation groups
											sprang up all over the country,
											and the modern gay rights 
movement as we know it took off.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So the next moment to look at on the timeline
											is the 1963 March on Washington.
											This was a seminal event
in the civil rights movement
											and it&#39;s where African-Americans called for both
											civil and economic justice.
											And it&#39;s of course where Martin Luther King
											delivered his famous &quot;I have a dream&quot; speech,
											but what&#39;s actually less known
											is that this march was organized
											by a man named Bayard Rustin.
											Bayard was an out gay man,
											and he&#39;s considered one of the most brilliant
											strategists of the civil rights movement.
											He later in his life became a fierce advocate
											of LGBT rights as well, and his life
											is testament to the intersection of the struggles.
											The March on Washington
											is one of the high points of the movement,
											and it&#39;s where there was a fervent belief
											that African-Americans too
											could be a part of American democracy.
											I call this strategy the
											&quot;We are visible and many in numbers&quot; strategy.

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Some early gay activists were actually
											directly inspired by the march,
											and some had taken part.
											Gay pioneer Jack Nichols said,
											&quot;We marched with Martin Luther King,
											seven of us from the Mattachine Society&quot; —
											which was an early gay rights organization —
											&quot;and from that moment on, we had our own dream
											about a gay rights march of similar proportions.&quot;
											Several years later, a series of marches took place,
											each one gaining the momentum
											of the gay freedom struggle.
											The first one was in 1979,
											and the second one took place in 1987.
											The third one was held in 1993.
											Almost a million people showed up,
											and people were so energized and excited
											by what had taken place,
											they went back to their own communities
											and started their own political
											and social organizations,
											further increasing the visibility of the movement.
											The day of that march, October 11,
											was then declared National Coming Out Day,
											and is still celebrated all over the world.
											These marches set the groundwork
											for the historic changes that we see happening
											today in the United States.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And lastly, the &quot;Loving&quot; strategy.
											The name speaks for itself.
											In 1967, the Supreme Court ruled
											in Loving v. Virginia,
											and invalidated all laws
											that prohibited interracial marriage.
											This is considered one of the Supreme Court&#39;s
											landmark civil rights cases.
											In 1996, President Clinton signed
											the Defense of Marriage Act, known as DOMA,
											and that made the federal government
											only have to recognize marriages
											between a man and a woman.
											In United States v. Windsor,
											a 79-year-old lesbian named Edith Windsor
											sued the federal government
											when she was forced to pay estate taxes
											on her deceased wife&#39;s property,
											something that heterosexual 
couples don&#39;t have to do.
											And as the case wound its way
											through the lower courts,
											the Loving case was repeatedly cited as precedent.
											When it got to the Supreme Court in 2013,
											the Supreme Court agreed,
											and DOMA was thrown out.
											It was incredible.
											But the gay marriage movement
											has been making gains for years now.
											To date, 17 states
											have passed laws allowing marriage equality.
											It&#39;s become the de facto battle
											for gay equality,
											and it seems like daily,
											laws prohibiting it are being challenged in the courts,
											even in places like Texas and Utah,
											which no one saw coming.

									<p>
											So a lot has changed
											since that night in 2008
											when I felt torn in half.
											I did go on to make that film.
											It&#39;s a documentary film,
											and it&#39;s called &quot;The New Black,&quot;
											and it looks at how the African-American community
											is grappling with the gay rights issue
											in light of the gay marriage movement
											and this fight over the meaning of civil rights.
											And I wanted to capture
											some of this incredible change that was happening,
											and as luck or politics would have it,
											another marriage battle started gearing up,
											this time in Maryland,
											where African-Americans make up 30 percent
											of the electorate.
											So this tension between gay rights
											and civil rights started to bubble up once again,
											and I was lucky enough to capture
											how some people were making the connection
											between the movements this time.
											This is a clip of Karess Taylor-Hughes
											and Samantha Masters, two characters in the film,
											as they hit the streets of Baltimore
											and try to convince potential voters.

											Yoruba Richen: Thank you.
											What&#39;s amazing to me about that clip
											that we just captured as we were filming
											is, it really shows how Karess
											understands the history
of the civil rights movement,
											but she&#39;s not restricted by it.
											She doesn&#39;t just limit it to black people.
											She sees it as a blueprint
											for expanding rights to gays and lesbians.
											Maybe because she&#39;s younger, she&#39;s like 25,
											she&#39;s able to do this a little bit more easily,
											but the fact is that Maryland voters
											did pass that marriage equality amendment,
											and in fact it was the first time
											that marriage equality was directly voted on
											and passed by the voters.
											African-Americans supported it at a higher level
											than had ever been recorded.
											It was a complete turnaround from that night
											in 2008 when Proposition 8 was passed.
											It was, and feels, monumental.
											We in the LGBT community have gone
											from being a pathologized and reviled
											and criminalized group
											to being seen as part of the great human quest
											for dignity and equality.
											We&#39;ve gone from having to hide our sexuality
											in order to maintain our jobs and our families
											to literally getting a place at the table
											with the president
											and a shout out at his second inauguration.
											I just want to read what he said
											at that inauguration:
											&quot;We the people declare today
											that the most evident of truths,
											that all of us are created equal.
											It is the star that guides us still,
											just as it guided our forebears
											through Seneca Falls
											and Selma and Stonewall.&quot;
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now we know that everything is not perfect,
											especially when you look at what&#39;s happening
											with the LGBT rights issue internationally,
											but it says something about how far we&#39;ve come
											when our president puts the gay freedom struggle
											in the context of the other great freedom struggles
											of our time: the women&#39;s rights movement
											and the civil rights movement.
											His statement demonstrates not only
											the interconnectedness of those movements,
											but how each one borrowed
											and was inspired by the other.
											So just as Martin Luther King
											learned from and borrowed from Gandhi&#39;s tactics
											of civil disobedience and nonviolence,
											which became a bedrock of
the civil rights movement,
											the gay rights movement saw what worked
											in the civil rights movement,
											and they used some of those same strategies
											and tactics to make gains
											at an even quicker pace.

									<p>
											Maybe one more other reason
											for the relative quick progress
											of the gay rights movement.
											Whereas a lot of us continue to still live
											in racially segregated spaces,
											LGBT folks, we are everywhere.
											We are in urban communities
											and rural communities,
											communities of color, immigrant communities,
											churches and mosques and synagogues.
											We are your mothers and brothers
											and sisters and sons.
											And when someone that you love
											or a family member comes out,
											it may be easier to support their quest for equality.
											And in fact, the gay rights movement
											asks us to support justice and equality
											from a space of love.
											That may be the biggest, greatest gift
											that the movement has given us.
											It calls on us to access that which is most universal
											and most intimate:
											a love of our brother and our sister
											and our neighbor.
											I just want to end with a quote
											by one of our greatest freedom fighters
											who&#39;s no longer with us, Nelson Mandela
											of South Africa.
											Nelson Mandela led South Africa
											after the dark and brutal days of Apartheid,
											and out of the ashes of that 
legalized racial discrimination,
											he led South Africa to become the first country
											in the world to ban discrimination
											based on sexual orientation within its constitution.
											Mandela said,
											&quot;For to be free is not merely to cast off one&#39;s chains,
											but to live in a way that respects
											and enhances the freedom of others.&quot;
