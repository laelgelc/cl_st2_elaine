<title>Eric Dishman: Take health care off the mainframe | TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript | TED</title>
<meta name="description" content="TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: At TEDMED, Eric Dishman makes a bold argument: The US health care system is like computing circa 1959, tethered to big, unwieldy central systems: hospitals, doctors, nursing homes. As our aging population booms, it&#39;s imperative, he says, to create personal, networked, home-based health care for all." />

											Now, we also do some pretty amazing things with these phones.

											&quot;Hello? Hey.&quot;
											All right? That&#39;s the first time.
											&quot;Hello? Uh, hey.&quot;
											&quot;Hello? Uh, who?

											All right? Very big differences

											or they do a lot of what&#39;s called trouble talk,
											where they&#39;re like, &quot;Wait, who is this? Oh.&quot; Right?

											There&#39;s lots of others. Is the person going to the phone
											as quickly, when it rings, as they used to?
											Is it a hearing problem or is it a physicality problem?
											Has their voice gotten more quiet? We&#39;re doing a lot of work with people
											with Alzheimer&#39;s and particularly with Parkinson&#39;s,
											where that quiet voice that sometimes shows up with Parkinson&#39;s patients
											may be the best early indicator

											to a personal health model,
											or to mean something more than just a debate
											about the public option and how we&#39;re going to finance.
											It doesn&#39;t matter how we finance healthcare.
											We&#39;re going to figure something out
											for the next 10 years, and try it.
											No matter who pays for it,
											we better start doing care in a fundamentally different way
											and treating the home and the patient
											and the family member and the caregivers
											as part of these coordinated care teams
											and using disruptive technologies that are already here
											to do care in some pretty fundamental different ways.

											The president needs to stand up and say,
											at the end of a healthcare reform debate,
											&quot;Our goal as a country is to move 50 percent of care
											out of institutions, clinics, hospitals and nursing homes,
											to the home, in 10 years.&quot;
											It&#39;s achievable. We should do it economically,
											we should do it morally,
											and we should do it for quality of life.
											But there is no goal within this health reform.
											It&#39;s just a mess today.

									<p>
											So, you know, that&#39;s my last message to you.
											How do we set a going-to-the-moon goal
											of dealing with the Y2K +10 problem that&#39;s coming?
											It&#39;s not that innovation and technology is going to be the
											magic pill that cures all, but it&#39;s going to be part of the solution.
											And if we don&#39;t create a personal health movement,
											something that we&#39;re all aiming towards in reform,
											then we&#39;re going to move nowhere.
											So, I hope you&#39;ll turn this conference into that kind of movement forward.
											Thanks very much.
											(Applause)
