											In my family, we collect
these vintage European posters.
											Every time we go to Maui,
we go to the dealer there,

											I love them. They all have one idea

that conveys the idea.

											They&#39;re not as thick as a mattress,

to change the world

effectively through them.
											And changing the world is hard.
											It won&#39;t happen with just one person
with one single idea.
											That idea has got to spread,

											and out into the open for people to see.

the most effectively is through story.

											You know, for thousands of years,

you get a physical reaction;

in the pit of my stomach.&quot;
											We actually physically react

incorporate story into presentations.
											So we&#39;ve had thousands of presentations
back at the shop —
											hundreds of thousands
of presentations, actually,

of a really bad presentation.
											I decided to study cinema and literature,

											So it was obvious to start with Aristotle,
											he had a three-act structure,
a beginning, a middle and an end.
											We studied poetics and rhetoric,
											and a lot of presentations don&#39;t even
have that in its most simple form.
											And then when I moved on
to studying hero archetypes,
											I thought, &quot;OK, the presenter is the hero,
											they&#39;re up on the stage,
they&#39;re the star of the show.&quot;
											It&#39;s easy to feel, as the presenter,
that you&#39;re the star of the show.
											I realized right away,
that that&#39;s really broken.
											Because I have an idea,
I can put it out there,
											but if you guys don&#39;t grab that idea
and hold it as dear,
											the idea goes nowhere
and the world is never changed.
											So in reality,
the presenter isn&#39;t the hero,
											the audience is the hero of our idea.

											So if you look at
Joseph Campbell&#39;s hero&#39;s journey,
											just in the front part, there were
some really interesting insights there.
											So there is this likable hero
in an ordinary world,
											and they get this call to adventure.
											So the world is
kind of brought out of balance.
											And at first they&#39;re resistant.
											They&#39;re like, &quot;I don&#39;t know
if I want to jump into this,&quot;
											and then a mentor comes along
											and helps them move
from their ordinary world
											into a special world.
											And that&#39;s the role of the presenter.
											It&#39;s to be the mentor.
You&#39;re not Luke Skywalker, you&#39;re Yoda.
											You&#39;re the one
that actually helps the audience
											move from one thing
and into your new special idea,
											and that&#39;s the power of a story.
											So in its most simple structure,
it&#39;s a three-part structure of a story.
											You have a likable hero who has a desire,
											they encounter a roadblock
											and ultimately they emerge, transform,
and that&#39;s the basic structure.

											But it wasn&#39;t until I came across
a Gustav Freytag&#39;s pyramid —
											he drew this shape in 1863.
											Now, he was a German dramatist ...
											he was a German dramatist
											and he believed
there is a five-act structure,

											a climax, a falling action
and a denouement,
											which is the unraveling
or the resolution of the story.
											I love this shape.
So we talk about shapes.
											A story has an arc —
well, an arc is a shape.
											We talk about classical music
having a shapeliness to it.

											At the beginning of any presentation,
you need to establish what is.
											You know, here&#39;s the status quo,
here&#39;s what&#39;s going on.
											And then you need
to compare that to what could be.
											You need to make that gap
as big as possible,
											because there is this commonplace
of the status quo,
											and you need to contrast that
with the loftiness of your idea.
											So it&#39;s like, you know,
here&#39;s the past, here&#39;s the present,
											but look at our future.
											Here&#39;s a problem,
but look at that problem removed.
											Here&#39;s a roadblock,
let&#39;s annihilate the roadblock.
											You need to really amplify that gap.
											This would be like
the inciting incident in a movie.
											That&#39;s when suddenly
the audience has to contend
											with what you just put out there:
											&quot;Wow, do I want to agree
with this and align with it or not?&quot;
											And in the rest of your presentation
should support that.

											So the middle goes back and forth,
											it traverses between
what is and what could be,
											what is and what could be.
											Because what you are trying to do
											is make the status quo
and the normal unappealing,
											and you&#39;re wanting to draw them

in the future with your idea adopted.

											Now, on your way to change the world,
people are going to resist.
											They&#39;re not going to be excited,
they may love the world the way it is.
											So you&#39;ll encounter resistance.
											That&#39;s why you
have to move back and forth.
											It&#39;s similar to sailing.
											When you&#39;re sailing against the wind
and there is wind resistance,
											you have to move your boat back and forth,
and back and forth.
											That&#39;s so you can capture the wind.
											You have to actually
capture the resistance
											coming against you when you&#39;re sailing.
											Now interesting,
if you capture the wind just right
											and you set your sail just right,
											your ship will actually
sail faster than the wind itself.
											It is a physics phenomenon.
											So by planting in there
											the way they&#39;re going to resist
between what is and what can be,
											is actually going to draw
them towards your idea

as a new bliss.
											&quot;This is utopia with my idea adopted.&quot;

											So let&#39;s walk through
how he actually spoke to the people.
											The blue bars here
are going to be when he used
											the actual rhetorical device
of repetition.
											So he was repeating himself,
											he was using the same words and phrases,
											so people could remember and recall them.
											But then he also used
a lot of metaphors and visual words.
											This was a way to take
really complicated ideas
											and make them memorable
and knowledgeable, so people got it.
											He actually created very —
											almost like scenes
with his words to make it
											so they could envision what he was saying.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And then there were also a lot of familiar
songs and scriptures that he used.
											This is just the front end of it
that you&#39;re seeing.
											And then he also made
a lot of political references
											of the promises
that were made to the people.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So if we look at
the very first end of what is,
											at the very end of what is
was the very first time
											that people actually clapped
and roared really loud.
											So the end of what is
what he did is he said,
											&quot;America has given
the Negro people a bad check,
											a check which has come back
marked insufficient funds.&quot;
											Well, everyone knows what it&#39;s like
to not have money in your account.
											So he used the metaphor
people were very familiar with.
											But when they really charged up,
											the very first time
they really screamed was:
											&quot;So we have come to cash this check,
											a check that will give us upon demand
											the riches of freedom
and the security of justice.&quot;
											That&#39;s when they really clapped.
											It was when he compared
what currently is to what could be.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So when we move along
a little farther in the model,
											you&#39;ll see it goes back and forth
at a more frenzied pace.
											And this is when he goes
back and forth, and back and forth.
											Now the audience was in a frenzy.
											They were all excited,
and so you can actually do this
											to keep them in a heightened
sense of excitement.
											So he says, &quot;I have a dream
											that one day this nation will rise up
and live out the meaning of its creed.
											&#39;We hold these truths to be self-evident,
that all men are created equal.&#39;&quot;
											So he uses the little orange text there
to remind them of the promise
											that the politicians had made to him
or that this country had made.
											Then he moves back and forth between
											&quot;I have a dream that one day,
I have a dream that one day,
											I have a dream that one day,&quot;
											and at the end,
it gets really interesting.
											Because he uses —
you can look at the four shades of green,
											there&#39;s a lot of blue there,
which was a lot of repetition —
											he had a heightened sense of repetition.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And the green was a heightened sense
of songs and scriptures.
											So the first batch of green
											was the actual scripture
from the Book of Isaiah.
											The second batch of green
was &quot;My Country, &#39;Tis of Thee.&quot;
											Now, that&#39;s a familiar song
that was specifically very significant
											for the black people at the time,
											because this song was the song they
chose to change the words to as an outcry,
											saying that promises had not been kept.
											So the third batch of green was actually
a stanza from &quot;My Country, &#39;Tis of Thee.&quot;
											And then the fourth was a Negro spiritual.
											&quot;Free at last! Free at last!
Thank God Almighty, I&#39;m free at last!&quot;

									<p>
											So what he did is he actually reached
inside of the hearts of the audience.
											He pulled from scriptures,
which is important.
											He pulled from songs
that they&#39;d sung together
											as an outcry against this outrage,
											and he used those as a device
to connect and resonate with the audience.
											Ending — painting a picture
of this new bliss,
											using the very things inside of them
that they already held as sacred.

											So he was a great man.
He had a big, big dream.
											There&#39;s a lot of people here,
you guys have really big dreams.
											You have really big ideas inside of you
											that you need to get out.
											But you know what? We encounter hardships.
											It&#39;s not easy to change the world;
											it&#39;s a big job.
											You know he was —
											his house was bombed,
he was stabbed with a letter opener,
											ultimately, he lost his life,
											you know, for what he cared about.
											But a lot of us aren&#39;t going to
be required to pay that kind of sacrifice.
											But what happens is
											that it basically is a little bit
like that basic story structure.
											Life can be like that.

											It&#39;s been rejected.&quot;
											You know, we self-sabotage our own ideas,

and butt up against the roadblocks
											instead of choosing
to let the struggle transform us

											I was raised in an economically
and emotionally starved environment.
											First time I got to go to a camp

											Yeah, that was tumultuous,
and when they weren&#39;t fighting
											they were helping sober up
some alcoholic that was living with us
											because they were both sober alcoholics.
											So my mom abandoned us
when I was sixteen years old.
											And I took on a role of caretaker
of my home and of my siblings.
											And I married. I met a man.
											Fell in love. I went to a year of college.
											I did what every single,
