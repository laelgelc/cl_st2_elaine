											I was just 22 years old at the time,

America&#39;s most violent hate movement.

											But I wasn&#39;t born into hate;
											in fact, it was quite the opposite.
											I had a relatively normal childhood.
											My parents are Italian immigrants
											who came to the United States
in the mid-1960s
											and settled on the South Side of Chicago,
											where they eventually met,
											and opened a small beauty shop.
											Right after I was born,
things got a little bit more difficult.
											They struggled to survive with raising
a young family and a new business,
											often working seven days a week,
											14 hours a day,
											taking on second and third jobs
just to earn a meager living.
											And quality time with my parents
was pretty nonexistent.
											Even though I knew
they loved me very much,
											growing up, I felt abandoned.
											I was lonely, and I started to withdraw,
											and then I started to resent my parents
and become very angry.
											And as I was growing up,
through my teenage years,
											I started to act out to try and get
attention from my parents.

											And one day, when I was 14,
											I was standing in an alley,
and I was smoking a joint,

with a shaved head and tall black boots,

											and he snatched the joint from my lips.
											Then he put his hand on my shoulder
and he looked me in the eyes,

											&quot;That&#39;s what the communists
and the Jews want you to do
											to keep you docile.&quot;

											I started to listen to the rhetoric
											and believe it.
											I started to watch very closely
as the leaders of this organization
											would target vulnerable young people
who felt marginalized
											and then draw them in
with promises of paradise
											that were broken.
											And then I started to recruit myself.
											I started to do that by making
white-power music.
											And soon, I became the leader
of that infamous organization
											that was led by that man in that alley
											who recruited me that day,
											who was America&#39;s first neo-Nazi skinhead
and who had radicalized me.
											For the next eight years,
											I believed the lies that I had been fed.
											And though I saw
no evidence of it whatsoever,
											I didn&#39;t hesitate to blame
every Jewish person in the world
											for what I thought was a white,
European genocide
											being promoted by them
through a multiculturalist agenda.
											I blamed people of color
											for the crime and violence
and the drugs in the city,
											completely neglecting the fact
that I was committing acts of violence
											on a daily basis,
											and that in many cases,
											it was white supremacists
who were funneling drugs
											into the inner cities.
											And I blamed immigrants
											for taking jobs from white Americans,
											completely neglecting the fact that
my parents were hardworking immigrants
											who struggled to survive,
											despite not getting help
from anybody else.

											For the next eight years,
											I saw friends die,
											I saw others go to prison
and inflict untold pain
											on countless victims
and their families&#39; lives.
											I heard horrific stories
from young women in the movement,
											who&#39;d been brutally raped by the very men
they were conditioned to trust,
											and I myself committed acts
of violence against people,
											solely for the color of their skin,
											who they loved,
											or the god that they prayed to.
											I stockpiled weapons for what I thought
was an upcoming race war.
											I went to six high schools;
											I was kicked out of four of them,
											one of them, twice.
											And 25 years ago, I wrote
and performed racist music
											that found its way
to the internet decades later
											and partially inspired
a young white nationalist
											to walk into a sacred Charleston,
South Carolina, church
											and senselessly massacre
nine innocent people.

											But then my life changed.
											At 19 years old, I met a girl
who was not in the movement,
											who didn&#39;t have a racist bone in her body,
											and I fell in love with her.
											And at 19, we got married,
											and we had our first son.
											And when I held my son in my arms
in the delivery room that day,
											not only did I reconnect
with some of the innocence that I had lost
											at 14 years old,
											but it also began to challenge
											the very important things that drew
me to the movement to begin with:
											identity, community and purpose —
											things that I had been
struggling with as a young boy.
											And now, I struggled with the concept
of who I was again.
											Was I this neo-Nazi hatemonger,
											or was I a caring father and husband?
											Was my community the one
that I had manufactured around me
											to boost my own ego,
											because I felt self-hatred for myself
and I wanted to project it onto others,
											or was it the one
that I had physically given life to?
											Was my purpose to scorch the earth
											or was it to make it
a better place for my family?
											And suddenly, like a ton of bricks hit me,
											I became very confused with
who I&#39;d been for the last eight years.
											And if only I&#39;d been brave enough
to walk away at that moment,
											to understand what the struggle was
that was happening inside of me,
											then maybe tragedy
could have been averted.

											Instead, I did compromise.
											I took myself off the streets
for the benefit of my family,
											because I was nervous that maybe
I could go to jail or end up dead,
											and they would have to fend
for themselves.
											So I stepped back as a leader,
											and instead I opened a record store
											that I was going to sell
white-power music in, of course,
											because I was importing it in from Europe.
											But I knew that if I was just
a racist store selling racist music
											the community would not
allow me to be there.
											So I decided I was going to also
stock the shelves with other music,
											like punk rock and heavy metal
											and hip-hop.
											And while the white-power music
that I was selling
											was 75 percent of my gross revenue,
											because people were driving in
from all over the country to buy it
											from the only store that was selling it,

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">

											I also had customers come in
to buy the other music.
											And eventually, they started
to talk to me.
											One day, a young black teen came in,
											and he was visibly upset.
											And I decided to ask him what was wrong.
											And he told me that his mother
had been diagnosed with breast cancer.
											And suddenly, this young black teenager,
											who I&#39;d never had a meaningful
conversation or interaction with,
											I was able to connect with,
											because my own mother
had been diagnosed with breast cancer,
											and I could feel his pain.
											On another occasion, a gay couple
came in with their son,
											and it was undeniable to me
that they loved their son
											in the same profound ways
that I loved mine.
											And suddenly, I couldn&#39;t rationalize
or justify the prejudice
											that I had in my head.

									<p>
											I decided to pull the white-power
music from the inventory
											when I became too embarrassed
to sell it in front of my new friends.
											And of course, the store
couldn&#39;t sustain itself,
											so I had to close it.
											At that same time, I lost
nearly everything in my life.
											I used it as an opportunity to walk away
											from the movement that
I&#39;d been a part of for eight years,
											the only identity, community and purpose
that I&#39;d really known for most of my life.
											So I had nobody.
											I lost my livelihood
because I closed the store.
											I didn&#39;t have a great relationship
with my parents, even though they tried.
											And my wife and children left me,
											because I hadn&#39;t left the movement
and disengaged quickly enough.
											And suddenly,
											I didn&#39;t know who I was again,
											or where I fit in
											or what my purpose was supposed to be.
											I was miserable inside,
											and I often woke up in the morning
											wishing that I hadn&#39;t.

											Why the hell would I want to do that?

anything to do with them.&quot;
											I said, &quot;OK.&quot;
											So I excused myself,
and I went into the bathroom
											and I took my phone out in the bathroom,
											and I Googled the local mosque,
											and I called them very quietly
from the bathroom,
											and I said, &quot;Excuse me,
imam, I need a favor.
											I have a Christian man
											who would really love to learn more
about your religion.&quot;

for Darrell to go,

15 minutes left for us,

for a prayer service.

											You see, it&#39;s our disconnection
from each other.
											Hatred is born of ignorance.
											Fear is its father,
and isolation is its mother.
											When we don&#39;t understand something,
we tend to be afraid of it,
											and if we keep ourselves from it,
											that fear grows, and sometimes,
it turns into hatred.
											Since I&#39;ve left the movement,
I&#39;ve helped over a hundred people

											I&#39;d like to just leave you

											Of all the people I&#39;ve worked with,
