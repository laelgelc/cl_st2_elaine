<meta content='Bill Ford is a car guy — his great-grandfather was Henry Ford, and he grew up inside the massive Ford Motor Co. So when he worries about cars&#x0027; impact on the environment, and about our growing global gridlock problem, it&#x0027;s worth a listen. His vision for the future of mobility includes "smart roads," even smarter public transport and going green like never before.' itemprop='description'>

											By birth and by choice,
											I&#39;ve been involved with the auto industry my entire life,
											and for the past 30 years,
											I&#39;ve worked at Ford Motor Company.
											And for most of those years,
											I worried about,
											how am I going to sell more cars and trucks?
											But today I worry about,
											what if all we do is sell more cars and trucks?
											What happens
											when the number of vehicles on the road doubles, triples,
											or even quadruples?

									<p>
											My life is guided by two great passions,
											and the first is automobiles.
											I literally grew up with the Ford Motor Company.
											I thought it was so cool as a little boy
											when my dad would bring home the latest Ford or Lincoln
											and leave it in the driveway.
											And I decided about that time, about age 10,
											that it would be really cool if I was a test driver.
											So my parents would go to dinner.
											They&#39;d sit down; I&#39;d sneak out of the house.
											I&#39;d jump behind the wheel and take the new model around the driveway,
											and it was a blast.
											And that went on for about two years,
											until — I think I was about 12 —
											my dad brought home
											a Lincoln Mark III.
											And it was snowing that day.
											So he and mom went to dinner,
											and I snuck out
											and thought it&#39;d be really cool to do donuts
											or even some figure-eights in the snow.
											My dad finished dinner early that evening.
											And he was walking to the front hall
											and out the front door
											just about the same time I hit some ice
											and met him at the front door with the car —
											and almost ended up in the front hall.
											So it kind of cooled my test-driving for a little while.
											But I really began to love cars then.
											And my first car was a 1975 electric-green Mustang.
											And even though the color was pretty hideous,
											I did love the car,
											and it really cemented my love affair with cars
											that&#39;s continued on to this day.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											But cars are really more than a passion of mine;
											they&#39;re quite literally in my blood.
											My great grandfather was Henry Ford,
											and on my mother&#39;s side,
											my great grandfather was Harvey Firestone.
											So when I was born,
											I guess you could say expectations were kind of high for me.
											But my great grandfather, Henry Ford,
											really believed that the mission of the Ford Motor Company
											was to make people&#39;s lives better
											and make cars affordable so that everyone could have them.
											Because he believed that with mobility
											comes freedom and progress.
											And that&#39;s a belief that I share.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											My other great passion is the environment.
											And as a young boy, I used to go up to Northern Michigan
											and fish in the rivers that Hemingway fished in
											and then later wrote about.
											And it really struck me
											as the years went by,
											in a very negative way,
											when I would go to some stream that I&#39;d loved,
											and was used to walking through this field
											that was once filled with fireflies,
											and now had a strip mall or a bunch of condos on it.
											And so even at a young age,
											that really resonated with me,
											and the whole notion of environmental preservation,
											at a very basic level, sunk in with me.
									</p>

								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											As a high-schooler, I started to read
											authors like Thoreau and Aldo Leopold
											and Edward Abbey,
											and I really began to develop
											a deeper appreciation of the natural world.
											But it never really occurred to me
											that my love of cars and trucks
											would ever be in conflict with nature.
											And that was true
											until I got to college.
											And when I got to college, you can imagine my surprise
											when I would go to class
											and a number of my professors would say
											that Ford Motor Company and my family
											was everything that was wrong with our country.
											They thought that we were more interested, as an industry,
											in profits, rather than progress,
											and that we filled the skies with smog —
											and frankly, we were the enemy.

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											I joined Ford after college,
											after some soul searching
											whether or not this is really the right thing to do.
											But I decided that I wanted to go
											and see if I could affect change there.
											And as I look back over 30 years ago,
											it was a little naive to think at that age
											that I could. But I wanted to.
											And I really discovered
											that my professors weren&#39;t completely wrong.
											In fact, when I got back to Detroit,
											my environmental leanings weren&#39;t exactly embraced
											by those in my own company,
											and certainly by those in the industry.
											I had some very interesting conversations,
											as you can imagine.
											There were some within Ford
											who believed that all this ecological nonsense
											should just disappear
											and that I needed to stop hanging out
											with &quot;environmental wackos.&quot;
											I was considered a radical.
											And I&#39;ll never forget the day I was called in by a member of top management
											and told to stop associating
											with any known or suspected environmentalists.
											(Laughter)
											Of course, I had no intention of doing that,
											and I kept speaking out about the environment,
											and it really was the topic
											that we now today call sustainability.
											And in time, my views went from controversial
											to more or less consensus today.
											I mean, I think most people in the industry
											understand that we&#39;ve got to get on with it.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											And the good news is today we are tackling the big issues,
											of cars and the environment —
											not only at Ford, but really as an industry.
											We&#39;re pushing fuel efficiency to new heights.
											And with new technology,
											we&#39;re reducing — and I believe, someday we&#39;ll eliminate —
											CO2 emissions.
											We&#39;re starting to sell electric cars, which is great.
											We&#39;re developing alternative powertrains
											that are going to make cars affordable
											in every sense of the word —
											economically, socially
											and environmentally.
											And actually, although we&#39;ve got a long way to go
											and a lot of work to do,
											I can see the day where my two great passions —
											cars and the environment —
											actually come into harmony.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											But unfortunately,
											as we&#39;re on our way to solving one monstrous problem —
											and as I said, we&#39;re not there yet; we&#39;ve got a lot of work to do,
											but I can see where we will —
											but even as we&#39;re in the process of doing that,
											another huge problem is looming,
											and people aren&#39;t noticing.
											And that is the freedom of mobility
											that my great grandfather brought to people
											is now being threatened, just as the environment is.
											The problem, put in its simplest terms,
											is one of mathematics.
											Today there are approximately 6.8 billion people in the world,
											and within our lifetime, that number&#39;s going to grow
											to about nine billion.
											And at that population level,
											our planet will be dealing with the limits of growth.
											And with that growth
											comes some severe practical problems,
											one of which is our transportation system
											simply won&#39;t be able to deal with it.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											When we look at the population growth in terms of cars,
											it becomes even clearer.
											Today there are about 800 million cars on the road worldwide.
											But with more people
											and greater prosperity around the world,
											that number&#39;s going to grow
											to between two and four billion cars by mid century.
											And this is going to create the kind of global gridlock
											that the world has never seen before.
											Now think about the impact
											that this is going to have on our daily lives.
											Today the average American
											spends about a week a year
											stuck in traffic jams,
											and that&#39;s a huge waste of time and resources.
											But that&#39;s nothing compared
											to what&#39;s going on
											in the nations that are growing the fastest.
											Today the average driver in Beijing
											has a five-hour commute.
											And last summer — many of you probably saw this —
											there was a hundred-mile traffic jam
											that took 11 days to clear in China.
											In the decades to come,
											75 percent of the world&#39;s population
											will live in cities,
											and 50 of those cities
											will be of 10 million people or more.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So you can see the size of the issue that we&#39;re facing.
											When you factor in population growth,
											it&#39;s clear that the mobility model that we have today
											simply will not work tomorrow.
											Frankly, four billion clean cars on the road
											are still four billion cars,
											and a traffic jam with no emissions
											is still a traffic jam.
											So, if we make no changes today,
											what does tomorrow look like?
											Well I think you probably already have the picture.
											Traffic jams are just a symptom of this challenge,
											and they&#39;re really very, very inconvenient,
											but that&#39;s all they are.
											But the bigger issue
											is that global gridlock
											is going to stifle economic growth
											and our ability to deliver
											food and health care,
											particularly to people that live in city centers.
											And our quality of life is going to be severely compromised.
											So what&#39;s going to solve this?

													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Well the answer isn&#39;t going to be more of the same.
											My great grandfather once said
											before he invented the Model T,
											&quot;If I had asked people then what they wanted,
											they would have answered,
											&#39;We want faster horses.&#39;&quot;
											So the answer to more cars
											is simply not to have more roads.
											When America began moving west,
											we didn&#39;t add more wagon trains,
											we built railroads.
											And to connect our country after World War II,
											we didn&#39;t build more two-lane highways,
											we built the interstate highway system.
											Today we need that same leap in thinking
											for us to create a viable future.
											We are going to build smart cars,
											but we also need to build
											smart roads, smart parking,
											smart public transportation systems and more.
											We don&#39;t want to waste our time
											sitting in traffic, sitting at tollbooths
											or looking for parking spots.
											We need an integrated system
											that uses real time data
											to optimize personal mobility on a massive scale
											without hassle or compromises for travelers.
											And frankly, that&#39;s the kind of system
											that&#39;s going to make the future of personal mobility sustainable.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now the good news is some of this work has already begun
											in different parts of the world.
											The city of Masdar in Abu Dhabi
											uses driverless electric vehicles
											that can communicate with one another,
											and they go underneath the city streets.
											And up above, you&#39;ve got a series of pedestrian walkways.
											On New York City&#39;s 34th Street,
											gridlock will soon be replaced
											with a connected system
											of vehicle-specific corridors.
											Pedestrian zones and dedicated traffic lanes are going to be created,
											and all of this will cut down the average rush hour commute
											to get across town in New York
											from about an hour today at rush hour
											to about 20 minutes.
											Now if you look at Hong Kong,
											they have a very interesting system called Octopus there.
											It&#39;s a system that really ties together
											all the transportation assets
											into a single payment system.
											So parking garages, buses, trains,
											they all operate within the same system.
											Now shared car services
											are also springing up around the world,
											and these efforts, I think, are great.
											They&#39;re relieving congestion,
											and they&#39;re frankly starting to save some fuel.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											These are all really good ideas
											that will move us forward.
											But what really inspires me
											is what&#39;s going to be possible
											when our cars can begin talking to each other.
											Very soon, the same systems that we use today
											to bring music and entertainment
											and GPS information into our vehicles
											are going to be used to create
											a smart vehicle network.
											Every morning I drive about 30 miles
											from my home in Ann Arbor to my office in Dearborn, Michigan.
											And every night I go home,
											my commute is a total crapshoot.
											And I often have to leave the freeway
											and look for different ways
											for me to try and make it home.
											But very soon we&#39;re going to see the days
											when cars are essentially talking to each other.
											So if the car ahead of me on I-94 hits traffic,
											it will immediately alert my car
											and tell my car to reroute itself
											to get me home in the best possible way.
											And these systems are being tested right now,
											and frankly they&#39;re going to be ready for prime time pretty soon.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											But the potential of a connected car network
											is almost limitless.
											So just imagine:
											one day very soon,
											you&#39;re going to be able to plan a trip downtown
											and your car will be connected to a smart parking system.
											So you get in your car,
											and as you get in your car,
											your car will reserve you a parking spot before you arrive —
											no more driving around looking for one,
											which frankly is one of the biggest users of fuel
											in today&#39;s cars in urban areas —
											is looking for parking spots.
											Or think about being in New York City
											and tracking down an intelligent cab on your smart phone
											so you don&#39;t have to wait in the cold to hail one.
											Or being at a future TED Conference
											and having your car
											talk to the calendars of everybody here
											and telling you all the best route to take home
											and when you should leave
											so that you can all arrive at your next destination on time.
											This is the kind of technology
											that will merge millions of individual vehicles
											into a single system.

											So I think it&#39;s clear we have the beginnings of a solution
											to this enormous problem.
											But as we found out with addressing CO2 issues,
											and also fossil fuels,
											there is no one silver bullet.
											The solution is not going to be
											more cars, more roads or a new rail system;
											it can only be found, I believe,
											in a global network
											of interconnected solutions.
											Now I know we can develop the technology
											that&#39;s going to make this work,
											but we&#39;ve got to be willing to get out there
											and seek out the solutions —
											whether that means vehicle sharing or public transportation
											or some other way we haven&#39;t even thought of yet;
											our overall transportation-mix and infrastructure
											must support all the future options.

											We need our best and our brightest
											to start entertaining this issue.
											Companies, entrepreneurs, venture capitalists,

											And just as these groups

											and it&#39;s really been amazing to me to watch
											how much brain power, how much money
											and how much serious thought
											has, really over the last three years,
											just poured into the green energy field.
											We need that same kind of passion and energy
											to attack global gridlock.
											But we need people like all of you in this room,
											leading thinkers.
											I mean, frankly, I need all of you
											to think about how
											you can help solve this huge issue.
											And we need people from all walks of life;

											You know, we&#39;ve come a long way.
											Since the Model T,
											most people never traveled
											more than 25 miles from home in their entire lifetime.
											And since then,
											the automobile has allowed us the freedom
											to choose where we live, where we work,
											where we play
											and frankly when we just go out and want to move around.
											We don&#39;t want to regress and lose that freedom.
											We&#39;re on our way to solving —
											and as I said earlier, I know we&#39;ve got a long way to go —
											the one big issue that we&#39;re all focused on that threatens it,
											and that&#39;s the environmental issue,
											but I believe we all must turn
											all of our effort and all of our ingenuity and determination
											to help now solve this notion of global gridlock.
											Because in doing so,
											we&#39;re going to preserve what we&#39;ve really come to take for granted,
											which is the freedom to move
											and move very effortlessly around the world.
											And it frankly will enhance our quality of life
											if we fix this.
											Because, if you can envision, as I do,
											a future of zero emissions
											and freedom to move around the country and around the world
											like we take for granted today,
											that&#39;s worth the hard work today
											to preserve that for tomorrow.
