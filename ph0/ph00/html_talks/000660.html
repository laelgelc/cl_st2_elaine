<meta content='My journey to thank all the people responsible for my morning coffee' itemprop='name'>
<meta content='Author AJ Jacobs embarked on a quest with a deceptively simple idea at its heart: to personally thank every person who helped make his morning cup of coffee. More than one thousand "thank yous" later, Jacobs reflects on the globe-trotting journey that ensued — and shares the life-altering wisdom he picked up along the way. "I discovered that my coffee would not be possible without hundreds of people I take for granted," Jacobs says.' itemprop='description'>

											So, I don&#39;t like to boast,
											but I am very good at finding things
to be annoyed about.
											It is a real specialty of mine.
											I can hear 100 compliments
and a single insult,
											and what do I remember?
											The insult.
											And according to
the research, I&#39;m not alone.

											Unfortunately, the human brain
is wired to focus on the negative.
											Now, this might have been helpful
when we were cave people,
											trying to avoid predators,
											but now it&#39;s a terrible way
to go through life.
											It is a real major component

											So how can we fight
the brain&#39;s negative bias?
											According to a lot of research,
one of the best weapons is gratitude.
											So knowing this, I started a new tradition
in our house a couple of years ago.
											Before a meal with my wife and kids,
											I would say a prayer of thanksgiving.
											Prayer is not quite the right word.
											I&#39;m agnostic, so instead of thanking God,
											I would thank some of the people
who helped make my food a reality.
											I&#39;d say, &quot;I&#39;d like to thank the farmer
who grew these tomatoes,
											and the trucker who drove
these tomatoes to the store,
											and the cashier
who rang these tomatoes up.&quot;

											And I thought it was going
pretty well, this tradition.
											Then one day, my 10-year-old son said,
											&quot;You know, Dad, those people
aren&#39;t in our apartment.
											They can&#39;t hear you.
											If you really cared, you would go
and thank them in person.&quot;
											And I thought, &quot;Hmm.
That&#39;s an interesting idea.&quot;

											Now I&#39;m a writer, and for my books
I like to go on adventures.
											Go on quests.
											So I decided I&#39;m going to take
my son up on his challenge.
											It seemed simple enough.
											And to make it even simpler,
											I decided to focus on just one item.
											An item I can&#39;t live without:
											my morning cup of coffee.
											Well, it turned out
to be not so simple at all.

											This quest took me months.
											It took me around the world.
											Because I discovered
that my coffee would not be possible

I take for granted.
											So I would thank the trucker
											who drove the coffee beans
to the coffee shop.

											on the hundreds of things
that go right every day,

											The first is: look up.
											I started my trail of gratitude
											by thanking the barista
at my local coffee shop,
											Joe Coffee in New York.
											Her name is Chung,
											and Chung is one of the most
upbeat people you will ever meet.
											Big smiler, enthusiastic hugger.

											is when people don&#39;t even treat her
like a human being.
											They treat her like a vending machine.
											So, they&#39;ll hand her their credit card
											without even looking up from their phone.
											And while she&#39;s saying this,
I&#39;m realizing I&#39;ve done that.
											I&#39;ve been that a-hole.
											And at that moment, I pledged:
											when dealing with people,
I&#39;m going to take those two seconds
											and look at them, make eye contact.
											Because it reminds you,
you&#39;re dealing with a human being
											who has family and aspirations

											Alright, second lesson was:
											smell the roses. And the dirt.
And the fertilizer.
											After Chung, I thanked this man.
											This is Ed Kaufmann.
											And Ed is the one who chooses which coffee
they serve at my local coffee shop.
											He goes around the world,
to South America, to Africa,
											finding the best coffee beans.
											So I thanked Ed.
											And in return, Ed showed me
how to taste coffee like a pro.
											And it is quite a ritual.
											You take your spoon
and you dip it in the coffee
											and then you take a big, loud slurp.
											Almost cartoonishly loud.
											This is because you want
to spray the coffee all over your mouth.
											You have taste buds
in the side of your cheeks,
											in the roof of your mouth,
											you&#39;ve got to get them all.
											So Ed would do this
											and he would —
											his face would light up and he would say,
											&quot;This coffee tastes of Honeycrisp apple
											and notes of soil and maple syrup.&quot;
											And I would take a sip and I&#39;d say,
											&quot;I&#39;m picking up coffee.

											But inspired by Ed, I decided to really
											let the coffee sit on my tongue
for five seconds —
											we&#39;re all busy,
but I could spare five seconds,
											and really think about the texture
and the acidity and the sweetness.
											And I started to do it with other foods.
											And this idea of savoring
is so important to gratitude.
											Psychologists talk about how gratitude
											is about taking a moment
and holding on to it as long as possible.
											And slowing down time.
											So that life doesn&#39;t go by

											Number three is:
											find the hidden masterpieces
all around you.
											Now, one of my favorite
conversations during this year
											was with the guy who invented
my coffee cup lid.
											And until this point,
											I had given approximately
zero thought to coffee cup lids.
											But I loved talking
to this inventor, Doug Fleming,
											because he was so passionate.
											And the blood and sweat and tears
he put into this lid,
											and that I had never even considered.
											He says a bad lid can ruin your coffee.
											That it can block the aroma,
											which is so important to the experience.
											So he — he&#39;s very innovative.
											He&#39;s like the Elon Musk of coffee lids.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So he designed this lid
that&#39;s got an upside-down hexagon
											so you can get your nose right in there
and get maximum aroma.
											And so I was delighted talking to him,
											and it made me realize there are
hundreds of masterpieces all around us
											that we totally take for granted.
											Like the on-off switch on my desk lamp
has a little indentation for my thumb
											that perfectly fits my thumb.
											And when something is done well,
											the process behind it
is largely invisible.
											But paying attention to it

											Number four is: fake it till you feel it.
											By the end of the project,
I was just in a thanking frenzy.
											So I was — I would get up
and spend a couple hours,
											I&#39;d write emails, send notes,
											make phone calls, visit people
											to thank them for their role in my coffee.
											And some of them, quite honestly —
											not that into it.
											They would be like, &quot;What is this?
											Is this a pyramid scheme,
what do you want, what are you selling?&quot;
											But most people were surprisingly moved.
											I remember, I called the woman
who does the pest control
											for the warehouse
where my coffee is served —
											I&#39;m sorry — where my coffee is stored.
											And I said,
											&quot;This may sound strange,
											but I want to thank you
for keeping the bugs out of my coffee.&quot;
											And she said, &quot;Well,
that does sound strange,
											but you just made my day.&quot;
											And it was like an anti-crank phone call.
											And it didn&#39;t just affect her,
it affected me.
											Because I would wake up every morning
in my default mood, which is grumpiness,
											but I would force myself
to write a thank-you note
											and then another and then another.
											And what I found was
that if you act as if you&#39;re grateful,
											you eventually become grateful for real.
											The power of our actions
to change our mind is astounding.
											So, often we think
that thought changes behavior,
											but behavior very often
changes our thought.

											And finally, the last lesson
I want to tell you about is:
											practice six degrees of gratitude.
											And every place, every stop
on this gratitude trail
											would give birth to 100 other people
that I could thank.
											So I went down to Colombia to thank
the farmers who grow my coffee beans.
											And it was in a small mountain town,
											and I was driven there
along these curvy, cliffside roads.
											And every time
we went around a hairpin turn
											the driver would do the sign of the cross.
											And I was like, &quot;Thank you for that.

									<p>
											But can you do that
while keeping your hands on the wheel?
											Because I am terrified.&quot;
											But we made it.
											And I met the farmers,
the Guarnizo brothers.
											It&#39;s a small farm, they make great coffee,
											they&#39;re paid above
fair-trade prices for it.
											And they showed me
how the coffee is grown.
											The bean is actually inside
this fruit called the coffee cherry.
											And I thanked them.
											And they said,
&quot;Well, we couldn&#39;t do our job
											without 100 other people.&quot;
											The machine that depulps the fruit
is made in Brazil,
											and the pickup truck
they drive around the farm,
											that is made from parts
from all over the world.
											In fact, the US exports steel to Colombia.
											So I went to Indiana,
and I thanked the steel makers.
											And it just drove home
											that it doesn&#39;t take a village
to make a cup of coffee.
											It takes the world
to make a cup of coffee.

											And this global economy,
this globalization,
											it does have downsides.
											But I believe the long-term
upsides are far greater,
											that progress is real.
											We have made improvements
in the last 50 years,
											poverty worldwide has gone down.
											And that we should resist the temptation
											to retreat into our silos.
											And we should resist this upsurge

											Which brings me to my final point.
											Which is my hope that we use gratitude
as a spark to action.
											Some people worry
that gratitude has a downside.
											That we&#39;ll be so grateful,
that we&#39;ll be complacent.
											We&#39;ll be so, &quot;Oh, everything&#39;s
wonderful, I&#39;m so grateful.&quot;
											Well, it turns out, the opposite is true.
											The research shows
											that the more grateful you are,
the more likely you are to help others.
											When you&#39;re in a bad state,
											you&#39;re often more focused
on your own needs.
											But gratitude makes you
want to pay it forward.
											And I experienced this personally.
											I mean, I&#39;m not Mother Teresa,
											I&#39;m still a selfish bastard
a huge amount of the time.
											But I&#39;m better than I was
before this project.
											And that&#39;s because it made me aware
											of the exploitation on the supply chain.
											It reminded me
that what I take for granted
											is not available to millions
of people around the world.

											Like water.
											Coffee is 98.8 percent water.
											So I figured I should go and thank
the people at the New York reservoir,
											hundreds of them, who provide me water,
											and this miracle that I can
turn a lever and get safe water.
											And that millions of people
around the world don&#39;t have this luxury
											and have to walk hours to get safe water.
											It inspired me to see what I could do
to help people get more access,
											and I did research
and found a wonderful group
											called Dispensers for Safe Water.
											And I got involved.
											And I&#39;m not expecting
the Nobel Prize committee
											to knock down my door,
											but it&#39;s a baby step,
it&#39;s a little something.
											And it&#39;s all because of gratitude.

Stubbornly curious and slyly perceptive, he takes immersive learning to its irrational and profoundly amusing extreme -- extracting wisdom and meaning after long stints as a self-styled guinea pig. For his <a href=\"http://blog.ted.com/2005/09/aj_jacobs_rocks.php\" target=\"_blank\">widely circulated</a> <em>Esquire</em> article, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.esquire.com/ESQ0905OUTSOURCING_214\" target=\"_blank\">My Outsourced Life</a>,&quot; he explored the phenomenon of outsourcing by hiring a team in Bangalore to take care of every part of his life -- from reading his emails to arguing with his wife to reading bedtime stories to his own son. A previous article, &quot;<a href=\"http://www.esquire.com/features/honesty0707\" target=\"_blank\">I Think You&#39;re Fat</a>,&quot; chronicled a brief, cringe-inducing attempt to live his life in Radical Honesty, telling all the truth, all the time. </p><p>Jacobs is author of <em><a href=\"http://geni.us/theknowitall\" target=\"_blank\">The Know-It-All</a></em>, which documents the year he spent reading the <em>Encyclopedia Britannica </em>from A to Z, uncovering both funny and surprising factoids but also poignant insight into history and human nature. In 2007 he released&nbsp;<em><a href=\"http://geni.us/yearoflivingbiblically\" target=\"_blank\">The Year of Living Biblically</a></em>, in which he attempted to follow every single rule in the Bible as literally as possible for an entire year. His book<em>&nbsp;</em><em><a href=\"http://geni.us/guineapigdiaries\" target=\"_blank\">The Guinea Pig Diaries: My Life as an Experiment</a>&nbsp;</em>is a collection of numerous personal experiments, including living according to George Washington&#39;s rules of conduct, outsourcing every single task to India and posing as a woman on an online dating site. Jacobs recently released a new book,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Thanks-Thousand-Gratitude-Journey-Books/dp/1501119923\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Thanks A Thousand: A Gratitude Journey</em></a>, which relates his life-altering journey&nbsp;to thank every single person involved in producing his morning cup of coffee.</p>"}],"url":"https://www.ted.com/talks/aj_jacobs_my_journey_to_thank_all_the_people_responsible_for_my_morning_coffee","viewed_count":1769124,"talks":[{"recommendations":{"status":"approved","headline":"AJ Jacobs recommends","blurb":"More resources curated by AJ Jacobs","start_at":null,"end_at":null,"published":true,"eyebrow":"","type":"recommendation","rec_lists":[{"title":"Books","description":"","rec_items":[{"label":"READ_Book","headline":"*Uncommon Grounds: The History of Coffee and How it Transformed our World*","blurb":"An excellent history of coffee and how it impacts everything in our lives -- the economy, the environment and intellectual history.

In 2007 he released&nbsp;<em><a href=\"http://geni.us/yearoflivingbiblically\" target=\"_blank\">The Year of Living Biblically</a></em>, in which he attempted to follow every single rule in the Bible as literally as possible for an entire year. His book<em>&nbsp;</em><em><a href=\"http://geni.us/guineapigdiaries\" target=\"_blank\">The Guinea Pig Diaries: My Life as an Experiment</a>&nbsp;</em>is a collection of numerous personal experiments, including living according to George Washington&#39;s rules of conduct, outsourcing every single task to India and posing as a woman on an online dating site. Jacobs recently released a new book,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Thanks-Thousand-Gratitude-Journey-Books/dp/1501119923\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Thanks A Thousand: A Gratitude Journey</em></a>, which relates his life-altering journey&nbsp;to thank every single person involved in producing his morning cup of coffee.</p>"}],"speaker_name":"AJ Jacobs","tags":["culture","TED Books","happiness","communication","community","humor","life","personal growth"],"title":"My journey to thank all the people responsible for my morning coffee","video_type":{"id":"7","name":"TED Salon Talk (partner)"},"viewed_count":1769124}]}})</script></div>
