<meta content='Science is a learning process that involves experimentation, failure and revision — and the science of medicine is no exception. Cancer researcher Kevin B. Jones faces the deep unknowns about surgery and medical care with a simple answer: honesty. In a thoughtful talk about the nature of knowledge, Jones shows how science is at its best when scientists humbly admit what they do not yet understand.' itemprop='description'>

											Science.
											The very word for many of you conjures
unhappy memories of boredom
											in high school biology or physics class.
											But let me assure that what you did there
											had very little to do with science.
											That was really the &quot;what&quot; of science.
											It was the history
of what other people had discovered.
											What I&#39;m most interested in as a scientist
											is the &quot;how&quot; of science.
											Because science is knowledge in process.
											We make an observation,
guess an explanation for that observation,
											and then make a prediction
that we can test
											with an experiment or other observation.

											A couple of examples.
											First of all, people noticed
that the Earth was below, the sky above,
											and both the Sun and the Moon
seemed to go around them.
											Their guessed explanation
											was that the Earth must be
the center of the universe.
											The prediction: everything
should circle around the Earth.
											This was first really tested
											when Galileo got his hands
on one of the first telescopes,
											and as he gazed into the night sky,
											what he found there was a planet, Jupiter,
											with four moons circling around it.
											He then used those moons
to follow the path of Jupiter
											and found that Jupiter
also was not going around the Earth
											but around the Sun.
											So the prediction test failed.
											And this led to
the discarding of the theory
											that the Earth was the center
of the universe.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Another example: Sir Isaac Newton
noticed that things fall to the Earth.
											The guessed explanation was gravity,
											the prediction that everything
should fall to the Earth.
											But of course, not everything
does fall to the Earth.
											So did we discard gravity?
											No. We revised the theory and said,
gravity pulls things to the Earth
											unless there is an equal
and opposite force in the other direction.
											This led us to learn something new.
											We began to pay more attention
to the bird and the bird&#39;s wings,
											and just think of all the discoveries
											that have flown
from that line of thinking.
											So the test failures,
the exceptions, the outliers
											teach us what we don&#39;t know
and lead us to something new.
											This is how science moves forward.
This is how science learns.

											Sometimes in the media,
and even more rarely,
											but sometimes even scientists will say
											that something or other
has been scientifically proven.
											But I hope that you understand
that science never proves anything
											definitively forever.
											Hopefully science remains curious enough
											to look for
											and humble enough to recognize
											when we have found
											the next outlier,
											the next exception,
											which, like Jupiter&#39;s moons,
											teaches us what we don&#39;t actually know.

											We&#39;re going to change gears
here for a second.
											The caduceus, or the symbol of medicine,
											means a lot of different things
to different people,
											but most of our
public discourse on medicine
											really turns it into
an engineering problem.
											We have the hallways of Congress,
											and the boardrooms of insurance companies
that try to figure out how to pay for it.
											The ethicists and epidemiologists
											try to figure out
how best to distribute medicine,
											and the hospitals and physicians
are absolutely obsessed
											with their protocols and checklists,
											trying to figure out
how best to safely apply medicine.
											These are all good things.
											However, they also all assume
											at some level
											that the textbook of medicine is closed.
											We start to measure
the quality of our health care
											by how quickly we can access it.
											It doesn&#39;t surprise me
that in this climate,
											many of our institutions
for the provision of health care
											start to look a heck of a lot
like Jiffy Lube.

											The only problem is that
when I graduated from medical school,
											I didn&#39;t get one of those
little doohickeys
											that your mechanic
has to plug into your car
											and find out exactly what&#39;s wrong with it,
											because the textbook of medicine
											is not closed.
											Medicine is science.
											Medicine is knowledge in process.
											We make an observation,
											we guess an explanation
of that observation,
											and then we make a prediction
that we can test.
											Now, the testing ground
of most predictions in medicine
											is populations.
											And you may remember
from those boring days in biology class
											that populations tend to distribute
											around a mean
											as a Gaussian or a normal curve.
											Therefore, in medicine,
											after we make a prediction
from a guessed explanation,
											we test it in a population.
											That means that what we know in medicine,
											our knowledge and our know-how,
											comes from populations
											but extends only as far
											as the next outlier,
											the next exception,
											which, like Jupiter&#39;s moons,
											will teach us what we don&#39;t actually know.

											Now, I am a surgeon
											who looks after patients with sarcoma.
											Sarcoma is a very rare form of cancer.
											It&#39;s the cancer of flesh and bones.
											And I would tell you that every one
of my patients is an outlier,
											is an exception.
											There is no surgery I have ever performed
for a sarcoma patient
											that has ever been guided
by a randomized controlled clinical trial,
											what we consider the best kind
of population-based evidence in medicine.
											People talk about thinking
outside the box,
											but we don&#39;t even have a box in sarcoma.
											What we do have as we take
a bath in the uncertainty
											and unknowns and exceptions
and outliers that surround us in sarcoma
											is easy access to what I think
are those two most important values
											for any science:
											humility and curiosity.
											Because if I am humble and curious,
											when a patient asks me a question,
											and I don&#39;t know the answer,
											I&#39;ll ask a colleague
											who may have a similar
albeit distinct patient with sarcoma.
											We&#39;ll even establish
international collaborations.
											Those patients will start
to talk to each other through chat rooms
											and support groups.
											It&#39;s through this kind
of humbly curious communication
											that we begin to try and learn new things.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
													<div class="Grid Grid--with-gutter d:f@md p-b:4">
								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											As an example, this is a patient of mine
											who had a cancer near his knee.
											Because of humbly curious communication
											in international collaborations,
											we have learned that we can repurpose
the ankle to serve as the knee
											when we have to remove the knee
with the cancer.
											He can then wear a prosthetic
and run and jump and play.
											This opportunity was available to him
											because of international collaborations.
											It was desirable to him
											because he had contacted other patients
who had experienced it.
											And so exceptions and outliers in medicine
											teach us what we don&#39;t know,
but also lead us to new thinking.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now, very importantly,
											all the new thinking that outliers
and exceptions lead us to in medicine
											does not only apply
to the outliers and exceptions.
											It is not that we only learn
from sarcoma patients
											ways to manage sarcoma patients.
											Sometimes, the outliers
											and the exceptions
											teach us things that matter quite a lot
to the general population.
											Like a tree standing outside a forest,
											the outliers and the exceptions
draw our attention
											and lead us into a much greater sense
of perhaps what a tree is.
											We often talk about
losing the forests for the trees,
											but one also loses a tree
											within a forest.
											But the tree that stands out by itself
											makes those relationships
that define a tree,
											the relationships between trunk
and roots and branches,
											much more apparent.
											Even if that tree is crooked
											or even if that tree
has very unusual relationships
											between trunk and roots and branches,
											it nonetheless draws our attention
											and allows us to make observations
											that we can then test
in the general population.

											I told you that sarcomas are rare.
											They make up about one percent
of all cancers.
											You also probably know that cancer
is considered a genetic disease.
											By genetic disease we mean
that cancer is caused by oncogenes
											that are turned on in cancer
											and tumor suppressor genes
that are turned off to cause cancer.
											You might think
that we learned about oncogenes
											and tumor suppressor genes
from common cancers
											like breast cancer and prostate cancer
											and lung cancer,
											but you&#39;d be wrong.
											We learned about oncogenes
and tumor suppressor genes
											for the first time
											in that itty-bitty little one percent
of cancers called sarcoma.
											In 1966, Peyton Rous got the Nobel Prize
											for realizing that chickens
											had a transmissible form of sarcoma.
											Thirty years later, Harold Varmus
and Mike Bishop discovered
											what that transmissible element was.
											It was a virus
											carrying a gene,
											the src oncogene.
											Now, I will not tell you
that src is the most important oncogene.
											I will not tell you
											that src is the most frequently
turned on oncogene in all of cancer.
											But it was the first oncogene.
											The exception, the outlier
											drew our attention and led us to something
											that taught us very important things
about the rest of biology.

											Now, TP53 is the most important
tumor suppressor gene.
											It is the most frequently turned off
tumor suppressor gene
											in almost every kind of cancer.
											But we didn&#39;t learn about it
from common cancers.
											We learned about it
when doctors Li and Fraumeni
											were looking at families,
											and they realized that these families
											had way too many sarcomas.
											I told you that sarcoma is rare.
											Remember that a one
in a million diagnosis,
											if it happens twice in one family,
											is way too common in that family.
											The very fact that these are rare
											draws our attention
											and leads us to new kinds of thinking.

											I&#39;ll never forget the night
											that I walked into
one of my patients&#39; rooms.
											I had been operating long that day
											but I still wanted to come and see him.
											He was a boy I had diagnosed
with a bone cancer a few days before.

to the hospital to begin chemotherapy.

											She came out in the hall
to chat with me for a few minutes.
											It turned out that
what she had been reading
											was the protocol
that the chemotherapy doctors
											had given her that day.
											She had memorized it.
											She said, &quot;Dr. Jones, you told me
											that we don&#39;t always win
											with this type of cancer,
											but I&#39;ve been studying this protocol,
and I think I can do it.
											I think I can comply
with these very difficult treatments.
											I&#39;m going to quit my job.

											I&#39;m going to keep my baby safe.&quot;

											that even if complied with,
											wouldn&#39;t necessarily save her son.

											No one in my family has sarcoma.

											I didn&#39;t tell you one dirty little secret.
											I told you that in medicine,
we test predictions in populations,

											that every time an individual

embedded in the general population,

a better or a worse result for you.

											A colleague of mine
removed a tumor from a patient&#39;s limb.
											He was concerned about this tumor.
											In our physician conferences,
he talked about his concern
											that this was a type of tumor
											that had a high risk
for coming back in the same limb.
											But his conversations with the patient
											were exactly what a patient might want:
											brimming with confidence.
											He said, &quot;I got it all
and you&#39;re good to go.&quot;
											She and her husband were thrilled.
											They went out, celebrated, fancy dinner,
opened a bottle of champagne.
											The only problem was a few weeks later,
											she started to notice
another nodule in the same area.
											It turned out he hadn&#39;t gotten it all,
and she wasn&#39;t good to go.
											But what happened at this juncture
absolutely fascinates me.
											My colleague came to me and said,
											&quot;Kevin, would you mind
looking after this patient for me?&quot;
											I said, &quot;Why, you know the right thing
to do as well as I do.
											You haven&#39;t done anything wrong.&quot;

a much more invasive surgery

that we&#39;re doing.
											This is what you&#39;re going to watch for.
											This is what I&#39;m going to watch for.
											And we&#39;re going to work together
to find out if this surgery will work
											to get rid of your cancer.&quot;
											I can guarantee you, she and her husband
