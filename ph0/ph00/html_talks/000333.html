											This is in Venice.
											I just show it because I want you to know
											I&#39;m concerned about context.
											On the left-hand side,
											I had the context of those little houses,
											and I tried to build a building that fit into that context.
											When people take pictures of these buildings out of that context
											they look really weird,
											and my premise is that they make a lot more sense
											when they&#39;re photographed or seen in that space.
											And then, once I deal with the context,
											I then try to make a place that&#39;s comfortable and private and fairly serene,

											And then I did a law school for Loyola in downtown L.A.
											I was concerned about making a place for the study of law.
											And we continue to work with this client.
											The building on the right at the top is now under construction.
											The garage on the right — the gray structure — will be torn down,
											finally, and several small classrooms will be placed
											along this avenue that we&#39;ve created, this campus.
											And it all related to the clients and the students
											from the very first meeting saying they felt denied a place.
											They wanted a sense of place.
											And so the whole idea here was to create that kind of space
											in downtown, in a neighborhood that was difficult to fit into.
											And it was my theory, or my point of view,
											that one didn&#39;t upstage the neighborhood —
											one made accommodations.
											I tried to be inclusive, to include the buildings in the neighborhood,

											This is a piece of property in Brentwood.
											And a long time ago, about &#39;82 or something, after my house —
											I designed a house for myself
											that would be a village of several pavilions around a courtyard —
											and the owner of this lot worked for me
											and built that actual model on the left.
											And she came back,
											I guess wealthier or something — something happened —
											and asked me to design a house for her on this site.
											And following that basic idea of the village,
											we changed it as we got into it.
											I locked the house into the site by cutting the back end —
											here you see on the photographs of the site —
											slicing into it and putting all the bathrooms and dressing rooms
											like a retaining wall, creating a lower level zone for the master bedroom,
											which I designed like a kind of a barge,
											looking like a boat.
											And that&#39;s it, built.
											The dome was a request from the client.
											She wanted a dome somewhere in the house.
											She didn&#39;t care where.
											When you sleep in this bedroom, I hope —
											I mean, I haven&#39;t slept in it yet.
											I&#39;ve offered to marry her so I could sleep there,
											but she said I didn&#39;t have to do that.
											But when you&#39;re in that room,
											you feel like you&#39;re on a kind of barge on some kind of lake.
											And it&#39;s very private.
											The landscape is being built around to create a private garden.
											And then up above there&#39;s a garden on this side of the living room,
											and one on the other side.

											Anyway, you enter into a garden with a beautiful grove of trees.
											That&#39;s the living room.
											Servants&#39; quarters.
											A guest bedroom, which has this dome with marble on it.
											And then you enter into the living room and then so on.
											This is the bedroom.
											You come down from this level along the stairway,
											and you enter the bedroom here, going into the lake.
											And the bed is back in this space,
											with windows looking out onto the lake.
											These Stonehenge things were designed to give foreground
											and to create a greater depth in this shallow lot.
											The material is lead copper, like in the building in Boston.
											And so it was an intent to make this small piece of land —
											it&#39;s 100 by 250 — into a kind of an estate by separating these areas
											and making the living room and dining room into this pavilion
											with a high space in it.
											And this happened by accident that I got this right on axis
											with the dining room table.
											It looks like I got a Baldessari painting for free.
											But the idea is, the windows are all placed
											so you see pieces of the house outside.
											Eventually this will be screened — these trees will come up —
											and it will be very private.

											And then this kind of twist, with this balcony and the skirt,

											The acoustician in the competition gave us criteria,

											and so that&#39;s one of the problems of a competition.

											And we studied many models.
											This was our original model.
											These were the three buildings that were the ideal —
											the Concertgebouw, Boston and Berlin.
											Everybody liked the surround.
											Actually, this is the smallest hall in size,
											and it has more seats than any of these
											because it has double balconies.
											Our client doesn&#39;t want balconies, so —

											the proportion of the Concertgebouw

											And our idea is to make the seating carriage very sculptural

											And the corners would have skylights
											and these columns would be structural.
											And the nice thing about introducing columns is they give you a

											and create intimacy.
											Now, this is not a final design — these are just on the way to being —
											and so I wouldn&#39;t take it literally, except the feeling of the space.
											We studied the acoustics with laser stuff,
											and they bounce them off this and see where it all works.
											But you get the sense of the hall in section.
											Most halls come straight down into a proscenium.
											In this case we&#39;re opening it back up
											and getting skylights in the four corners.

											It&#39;s a public space, and I made it kind of a garden structure,

											In Barcelona I was asked to do a fish, and we&#39;re working on that,
											at the foot of a Ritz-Carlton Tower being done by
											Skidmore, Owings and Merrill.
											And the Ritz-Carlton Tower is being designed with exposed steel,
											non-fire proof, much like those old gas tanks.
											And so we took the language of this exposed steel and used it,
											perverted it, into the form of the fish, and created a kind of
											a 19th-century contraption that looks like, that will sit —
											this is the beach and the harbor out in front,
											and this is really a shopping center with department stores.
											And we split these bridges.
											Originally, this was all solid with a hole in it.
											We cut them loose and made several bridges and created a kind of
											a foreground for this hotel.
											We showed this to the hotel people the other day,
											and they were terrified and said that nobody would come
											to the Ritz-Carlton anymore, because of this fish.

											And finally, I just threw these in — Lou Danziger.
