											Naomi McDougall-Jones: Here&#39;s the story.
											All my life I wanted to be an actress.
											From the time I was very small,
I could feel the magic of storytelling
											and I wanted to be a part of it.
											So, at the ripe age of 21,
											I graduated from the American
Academy of Dramatic Arts
											in New York City,
											bright-eyed and bushy-tailed,
and ready to take my rightful place
											as the next Meryl Streep.
											That&#39;s my grandmother, not Meryl Streep.

									<p>
											Now, it&#39;s important for this story
that you understand
											that I was raised by a raging feminist.
											I mean, just to give you some idea:
											when I was five or six years old
and obsessed with &quot;The Sound of Music,&quot;
											and running around, singing,
&quot;I am 16 going on 17,&quot;
											all day every day,
											my mother sat me down
for a very serious conversation
											and she said, &quot;OK, look.
											I&#39;m not going to say
that you can&#39;t sing that song,
											but if you are going to sing that song,
I do need you to understand
											the extremely problematic
gender construct that it reinforces.&quot;

											So, maybe a year or so after this,
											I&#39;m having lunch
with an actress friend of mine,
											and we&#39;re talking about
how insane this is.
											And we decide, you know what? No problem.
											We&#39;ll just make our own movie.
											And I&#39;ll write and then I&#39;ll write it
about two complex female characters.
											So we do.
											We set out to make this movie,
											and sort of accidentally, we end up hiring
an all-female production team:
											the writer, directors, producers,
											and it&#39;s a film about two women.
											And so pretty soon,
we&#39;re sitting in the office
											of a successful male producer,
											and he goes, &quot;OK, girls.
											So, you do understand that at some point
you are going to have to hire
											a male producer onboard, right?
											Just so that people
will trust you with their money.&quot;
											Over and over again, people tell us,
											&quot;Yeah, but people don&#39;t really
want to see films about women,
											so maybe you should think about
making something else.
											It&#39;s just the way it is.&quot;
											So we make the movie, anyway.
											We scrape together 80,000 dollars,
											and we make it, and it does so well.
											It gets into tons of festivals
and we win a lot of awards
											and it&#39;s big and exciting.

									<p>
											But these experiences I&#39;ve had
just keep rubbing at me.
											And so, I just start talking about them,
											first, at Q and A&#39;s after
screenings of the film,
											and then I get invited to be on panels
and talk at conferences.
											And the really amazing thing
is that, to begin with,
											when I&#39;m just talking to audiences
											and other people, you know,
coming up in the film industry,
											the universal reaction is,
											&quot;Oh my god! This is terrible.
What do we do about this?&quot;
											But the bigger panels I get on,
											suddenly an Oscar nominee tells me,
											&quot;Look, I totally agree
with everything you&#39;re saying.
											You just need to be really careful
about where you say it.&quot;
											An Oscar-winning producer tells me
											that she doesn&#39;t think it&#39;s a good idea
to play the woman card.
											It&#39;s just the way it is.

											And I think this is how
sexism continues on in 2016, right?
											For the most part, it happens casually —
											unconsciously, even.
											It happens because people
are just trying to get along
											within an existing system.
											It happens, maybe, out of a genuine desire
											to teach a young woman
the way that the world &quot;just is.&quot;
											The problem is that unless we do
something about it,
											that is the way the world will always be.

											Well, let me put it to you this way:
											the year &quot;Jaws&quot; came out,
											Americans suddenly started listing
&quot;sharks&quot; among their top 10 major fears.
											In 1995, BMW paid the James Bond franchise
three million dollars
											to have James Bond switch
from driving an Aston Martin
											to a BMW Z3.
											That one move caused so many people
to go out and buy that car,
											that BMW made 240 million dollars
in pre-sales alone.
											The year that &quot;Brave&quot;
and &quot;Hunger Games&quot; came out,
											female participation in archery
went up 105 percent.

											In fact, studies show

											So now, consider this:
											if you have watched
mostly American movies in your lifetime,
											95 percent of all the films
you have ever seen
											were directed by men.
											Somewhere between 80 and 90 percent
of all of the leading characters
											that you have ever seen
											were men.
											And even if we just talk about
the last five years,
											55 percent of the time
that you have seen a woman in a movie,
											she was naked or scantily clad.
											That affects you.
											That affects all of us.
											We actually can&#39;t even imagine
how much it affects us,
											because this is all we&#39;ve ever had.
											Stories — and movies
are just modern stories —
											are not frivolous.
											They&#39;re actually the mechanism
through which we process
											our experience of being alive.
											They&#39;re the way
that we understand the world
											and our place in it.
											They&#39;re the way we develop empathy
											for people who have experiences
different than our own.
											And right now, all of that
is being funneled at us
											through the prism of this one perspective.
											It&#39;s not that it&#39;s a bad perspective,

											So what do we do about this?
											This may be the first time
a lot of you are hearing about this,
											but a lot of us within the film industry
have spent years —
											a lot of people,
a lot longer than I have —
											giving speeches and doing panels
and writing articles
											and doing studies,
											and really just yelling at Hollywood
to do a better job about this.
											I mean, we have really yelled at them.
											And yet, Paramount and Fox
recently released their slates,
											and of the 47 films that they will release
between now and 2018,
											not a single one
will be directed by a woman.
											So it is beginning to occur to me
											that waiting for Hollywood
to grow a conscience
											may not actually be a winning strategy.
											In fact, it seems to me
											that whenever there is a small,
ruling class of people
											who have all of the money
and power and resources,
											they&#39;re not actually that excited
about giving it up.
											And so you don&#39;t get change by asking them
											or even yelling at them.
											You have to make that change happen
											through a revolution.
											Now, please don&#39;t worry —
I promise you, here, now, today,
											our body count will be very low.

											It&#39;s true.
											The Washington Post
recently released a study
											showing that films that feature women
make 23 cents more on every dollar
											than films that don&#39;t.
											Furthermore, my colleagues and I
commissioned a study
											comparing 1,700 films
made over the last five years
											and, looking at the average
returns on investment —
											so, how much money does that movie make —
											comparing if a man or a woman
filled each of the following roles:
											director, producer,
screenwriter and lead actor.
											And in every single category,
											the return on investment is higher
if it&#39;s a woman.
											Fact: women buy 51 percent
of all movie tickets.
											Films by and about women make more money.
											And of course, at least
some portion of the male population
											does also like women —

											so &quot;women films&quot; are not just for women.
											And yet, Hollywood only targets
18 percent of all of their films
											as &quot;women films.&quot;
											So what you&#39;re left with
is a giant underserved audience
											and untapped profit potential.
											So we exist, and we have stories to tell.
											We have so many stories to tell.
											And despite everything we&#39;ve heard:
you want to see them.

											OK, first I want to talk to anyone
who watches movies.
											Who watches movies in here?
											Great!
											Will you pledge to watch one film
by a female filmmaker per month?
											That&#39;s it, just start there. Great!
											If you need help finding them,
											you can go to the website, moviesbyher.com
											It&#39;s an easily searchable database
of films by women.
											And as you start watching all movies,
											I just want you to pay attention
to the female characters.
											How many of them are there?
											What are they wearing?
											Or not?
											Do they get to do cool things,
											or are they just there
to emotionally support the men?
											I&#39;m telling you, once you see this,
you&#39;re not going to be able to unsee it.
											And as you start noticing this,
it&#39;s going to shift your viewing habits.
											And this already sizable market
is going to continue to grow.

								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Step two: make movies.
											So now I&#39;m talking to all
the female filmmakers out there:
											we need you to be very brave.
											It will be harder for you to make movies.
											In fact, there will be an entire industry
constantly telling you
											that your stories don&#39;t matter.
											And we need you to make them, anyway.
											That 18 percent in the micro-budget
range — that is on us to fix.
											Don&#39;t wait for permission.
											Don&#39;t wait for somebody to pick you,
											because 95 percent says
they are not going to.
											Crowd fund.
											Write letters to eccentric relatives.
											I know how hard it is,
											but you have to make your movies —
now, today, features, not shorts.
											There is an audience for them,
and they want and need to see them.

								<div class="Grid__cell d:f h:full m-b:.5 m-b:0@md w:12"></div>

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Three: invest in each other.
											Fellow female filmmakers, I feel like
we need to stop wasting so much energy
											on a system that does not want us.
											We need to find our audience
and invest in cultivating them.
											If we can figure out
how to make our movies
											and deliver them
to the audiences that want them,
											that&#39;s it.
											That&#39;s the whole game.
											And whatever they&#39;re doing in the middle
											is going to cease to be
quite so important.
											Audiences, invest in us.
											Help us make the movies
that you want to see.
											If you can give a female filmmaker
25 dollars in a crowdfunding campaign,
											great, do that.
											If you can invest more seriously
											and help us over that critical
million-dollar hurdle,
											do that.
											But invest in seeing
the other half of the story.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Four: disrupt through business.
											So now I&#39;m talking
to all of the businesspeople
											and entrepreneurs.
											This does not happen
very often in the world,
											but right here we have a golden situation
											in which you can enact
significant social change
											while also making money.
											Hollywood is a system ripe for disruption.
											The old models of financing
and distribution are crumbling —
											please come in and disrupt it.
											I&#39;ll give you an example.
											Right now, with some incredible women,
											I am launching the &quot;The 51 Fund.&quot;
											It&#39;s a venture capital fund
											that will finance films written, directed
and produced by women
											in that critical $1-5 million range.
											We will give a significant number
of female filmmakers
											the chance to make their movies
											and we will deliver them
to the audiences who want them.
											Good for equality, good for business.
											But that&#39;s only one example, we need more.
											There is room for so many more.
											So I say to you:
											Hollywood is leaving money on the table.
											Come pick it up.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											Now, all of this may seem like a lot,
but it is actually so doable.
											Entrenched systems don&#39;t change
because you ask the people in charge,
											they change because all of the people
who don&#39;t have what they want
											rise up and make that change happen.
											And don&#39;t you want to?
											I want to see what the other
51 percent of the population has to say.
											I want to watch movies
that teach me about people
											who are different than I am.
											I want to see women&#39;s bodies on film
that aren&#39;t perfect.
											I want to give our little boys the chance
											to empathize with female characters
											so that they can become more whole men.
											And I definitely want
to give a little girl
											who may not have a real-life role model
											the chance to watch movies
											and see women doing everything
she dreams of achieving.

Atlanta.</p><p>McDougall Jones&#39;s award-winning second feature film,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.bitemethefilm.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Bite Me</em></a>, which she wrote, stars in and was a producer on, is a subversive romantic comedy about the real-life subculture of people who believe that they&#39;re vampires and the IRS agent who audits them. The film premiered at Cinequest, won Best Feature Film at VTXIFF and then went on to the innovative, paradigm-shifting Joyful Vampire Tour of America in summer 2019, a 51-screening, 40-city, three-month, RV-fueled eventized tour that involved Joyful Vampire Balls, capes, a docu-series and a whole lot of joy. The film is now available to watch on Seed&amp;Spark, Amazon, GooglePlay and iTunes.</p><p>McDougall Jones&#39;s first film, <em>Imagine I&#39;m Beautiful</em> (2014), which she also wrote, produced and starred in, took home 12 awards on the film festival circuit, including four Best Pictures and, for McDougall Jones, three Best Actress Awards and The Don Award for Best Independently Produced Screenplay of 2014. <em>Imagine I&#39;m Beautiful</em> is a &quot;haunting and empathetic&quot; psychological drama that dissects the fine line between self-invention and destruction. The film received a 10-city theatrical and digital release and is now available on iTunes, Amazon and GooglePlay.</p><p>McDougall Jones&#39; first book, <em>The Wrong Kind of Woman: Dismantling the Gods of Hollywood</em>, will be published by Beacon Press in February 2020 and is now available for pre-order on all major platforms.</p><p>She is also currently at work on her third feature screenplay, <em>Breathe In/Breathe Out</em>, a magical realism film that explores themes of identity, legacy and gender through a modern-day seven-month pregnant woman&#39;s unexpected interaction with the brilliant, eccentric and deceased inventor John Hays Hammond, Jr.,&nbsp;for which she received a place as the first artist-in-residence at Ernest Hemingway&#39;s final home in Sun Valley, Idaho.</p><p>She lives in Atlanta with her husband, Stephen.
