											Roger Ebert: These are my words, but this is not my voice.
											This is Alex, the best computer voice
											I&#39;ve been able to find,
											which comes as standard equipment on every Macintosh.
											For most of my life,
											I never gave a second thought to my ability to speak.
											It was like breathing.
											In those days, I was living in a fool&#39;s paradise.
											After surgeries for cancer
											took away my ability to speak, eat or drink,
											I was forced to enter this virtual world
											in which a computer does some of my living for me.

											For several days now,
											we have enjoyed brilliant and articulate speakers here at TED.
											I used to be able to talk like that.
											Maybe I wasn&#39;t as smart,
											but I was at least as talkative.
											I want to devote my talk today
											to the act of speaking itself,
											and how the act of speaking or not speaking
											is tied so indelibly to one&#39;s identity
											as to force the birth of a new person
											when it is taken away.
											However, I&#39;ve found that listening to a computer voice
											for any great length of time
											can be monotonous.
											So I&#39;ve decided to recruit some of my TED friends
											to read my words aloud for me.
											I will start with my wife, Chaz.

											Chaz Ebert: It was Chaz who stood by my side
											through three attempts to reconstruct my jaw
											and restore my ability to speak.
											Going into the first surgery
											for a recurrence of salivary cancer
											in 2006,
											I expected to be out of the hospital
											in time to return to my movie review show,
											&#39;Ebert and Roeper at the Movies.&#39;
											I had pre-taped enough shows
											to get me through six weeks of surgery
											and recuperation.
											The doctors took a fibula bone from my leg
											and some tissue from my shoulder
											to fashion into a new jaw.
											My tongue, larynx and vocal cords
											were still healthy and unaffected.

											CE: I was optimistic,
											and all was right with the world.
											The first surgery was a great success.
											I saw myself in the mirror
											and I looked pretty good.
											Two weeks later, I was ready to return home.
											I was using my iPod
											to play the Leonard Cohen song
											&#39;I&#39;m Your Man&#39;
											for my doctors and nurses.
											Suddenly, I had an episode of catastrophic bleeding.
											My carotid artery had ruptured.
											Thank God I was still in my hospital room
											and my doctors were right there.
											Chaz told me
											that if that song hadn&#39;t played for so long,
											I might have already been in the car, on the way home,
											and would have died right there and then.
											So thank you, Leonard Cohen,

											There was a second surgery —

											which also patched me back together pretty well,
											until it failed.
											A doctor from Brazil said
											he had never seen anyone survive
											a carotid artery rupture.
											And before I left the hospital,

											I had seven ruptures

											There was no particular day

											I would never speak again;

											Human speech
											is an ingenious manipulation of our breath
											within the sound chamber of our mouth
											and respiratory system.
											We need to be able to hold and manipulate that breath
											in order to form sounds.
											Therefore, the system
											must be essentially airtight
											in order to capture air.
											Because I had lost my jaw,
											I could no longer form a seal,
											and therefore my tongue
											and all of my other vocal equipment
											was rendered powerless.

											Dean Ornish: At first for a long time,
											I wrote messages in notebooks.
											Then I tried typing words on my laptop
											and using its built in voice.
											This was faster,
											and nobody had to try to read my handwriting.
											I tried out various computer voices that were available online,
											and for several months I had a British accent,
											which Chaz called Sir Lawrence.&quot;
											(Laughter)
											&quot;It was the clearest I could find.
											Then Apple released the Alex voice,
											which was the best I&#39;d heard.
											It knew things like the difference
											between an exclamation point and a question mark.
											When it saw a period, it knew how to make a sentence
											sound like it was ending instead of staying up in the air.
											There are all sorts of html codes you can use
											to control the timing and inflection of computer voices,
											and I&#39;ve experimented with them.
											For me, they share a fundamental problem: they&#39;re too slow.
											When I find myself in a conversational situation,
											I need to type fast and to jump right in.
											People don&#39;t have the time or the patience
											to wait for me to fool around with the codes

											But what value do we place on the sound of our own voice?
											How does that affect who you are as a person?
											When people hear Alex speaking my words,
											do they experience a disconnect?
											Does that create a separation or a distance
											from one person to the next?
											How did I feel not being able to speak?
											I felt, and I still feel,
											a lot of distance from the human mainstream.
											I&#39;ve become uncomfortable when I&#39;m separated from my laptop.

											So Chaz suggested finding a company that could make a customized voice
											using my TV show voice
											from a period of 30 years.
											At first I was against it.
											I thought it would be creepy
											to hear my own voice coming from a computer.
											There was something comforting about a voice that was not my own.
											But I decided then to just give it a try.
											So we contacted a company in Scotland
											that created personalized computer voices.
											They&#39;d never made one from previously-recorded materials.
											All of their voices had been made by a speaker
											recording original words in a control booth.
											But they were willing to give it a try.

								<div class="Grid__cell flx-s:1 p-r:4">
									<p>
											So I sent them many hours of recordings of my voice,
											including several audio commentary tracks
											that I&#39;d made for movies on DVDs.
											And it sounded like me, it really did.
											There was a reason for that; it was me.
											But it wasn&#39;t that simple.
											The tapes from my TV show weren&#39;t very useful
											because there were too many other kinds of audio involved —
											movie soundtracks, for example, or Gene Siskel arguing with me —
											(Laughter)
											and my words often had a particular emphasis
											that didn&#39;t fit into a sentence well enough.

											This is the first version of my computer voice.
											It still needs improvement,
											but at least it sounds like me
											and not like HAL 9000.
											When I heard it the first time,
											it sent chills down my spine.
											When I type anything,
											this voice will speak whatever I type.
											When I read something, it will read in my voice.
											I have typed these words in advance,

											This is the first voice they&#39;ve created for an individual.
											There are several very good voices available for computers,

											I plan to use it on television, radio

											People who need a voice should know
											that most computers already come with built-in speaking systems.
											Many blind people use them

											to interview the creators
											of something called PLATO.
											The initials stood for Programmed Logic
											for Automated Teaching Operations.

											It continued to evolve and operated in one form or another
											on more and more sophisticated computers,
											until only five years ago.
											I have learned from Wikipedia
											that, starting with that humble beginning,
											PLATO established forums, message boards,
											online testing,
											email, chat rooms,

											remote screen sharing

											It is human nature
											to look away from illness.
											We don&#39;t enjoy a reminder
											of our own fragile mortality.
											That&#39;s why writing on the Internet
											has become a lifesaver for me.
											My ability to think and write
											have not been affected.
											And on the Web, my real voice finds expression.
											I have also met many other disabled people
											who communicate this way.
											One of my Twitter friends
											can type only with his toes.
											One of the funniest blogs on the Web
											is written by a friend of mine
											named Smartass Cripple.
											(Laughter)
											Google him and he will make you laugh.
											All of these people are saying, in one way or another,
											that what you see

											So I have not come here to complain.
											I have much to make me happy and relieved.
											I seem, for the time being,
											to be cancer-free.
											I am writing as well as ever.
											I am productive.
											If I were in this condition at any point
											before a few cosmological instants ago,
											I would be as isolated as a hermit.
											I would be trapped inside my head.
											Because of the rush of human knowledge,
											because of the digital revolution,
											I have a voice,
											and I do not need to scream.

											You all know the test for artificial intelligence — the Turing test.
											A human judge has a conversation
											with a human and a computer.
											If the judge can&#39;t tell the machine apart from the human,
											the machine has passed the test.
											I now propose a test for computer voices — the Ebert test.
											If a computer voice can successfully tell a joke
											and do the timing and delivery as well as Henny Youngman,
											then that&#39;s the voice I want.

(And he was also the co-screenwriter of the Russ Meyer cult classic&nbsp;<em><a href=\"http://geni.us/beyondthevalley\" target=\"_blank\">Beyond the Valley of the Dolls</a>,</em>&nbsp;a fact that astounded more than a few young film students.)</p><p>In 2006, Ebert began treatment for thyroid cancer. He told the story of his many surgeries and setbacks in an <a href=\"http://www.esquire.com/features/roger-ebert-0310\" target=\"_blank\">immensely-worth-reading <em>Esquire</em> story</a> in 2010. Enduring procedure after procedure, he eventually lost the lower part of his jaw -- and with it his ability to eat and speak. Turning to his blog and to Twitter, he found a new voice for his film work and his sparkling thoughts on ... just about everything. He tried his hand as an Amazon affiliate, became a finalist in the New Yorker caption contest, and started a controversy or two. In 2013 Ebert passed away from cancer at the age of 70.</p>"}],"speaker_name":"Roger Ebert","tags":["community","culture","speech"],"title":"Remaking my voice","video_type":{"id":"1","name":"TED Stage Talk"},"viewed_count":1255392}]}})</script></div>
