One of the top chefs from Pasta Palace has been kidnapped by operatives from
Burger Bazaar hoping to learn the location of their secret sauce recipe. Little
do they know that a third party— Sausage Saloon— has sent you to take
advantage of the situation. As their top spy, your skills range from
infiltration and subterfuge, to safecracking and reading faces for signs of
deception.
You’ve tracked the captors to where they’re holding the chef prisoner. From
your hiding spot, you can see him on the other side of the glass, while in
front of you an interrogator wearing headphones speaks into a microphone.
“We already know the recipe is on the 13th floor of the bank vault, in a safe
deposit box numbered between 13 and 1300. Now tell us… Is the number less
than 500?”
You can’t hear the chef’s answer, but you can see that he’s lying. The
interrogator, however, falls for it. He follows up by asking, “Is it a
perfect square?” Again you can’t hear the answer but can tell the chef is
lying, while the interrogator takes him at his word. He then asks, “Is it a
perfect cube?” This time the chef answers truthfully.
The interrogator thinks for a minute and says, “Good. Now if you just tell me
whether or not the number’s second digit is a one, we’ll be done here.”
But as the chef starts to answer, the interrogator stands up, blocking your
view. Within moments he rushes out of the room, announcing that he’s got the
answer and is sending agents to retrieve the recipe.
You know that the Burger Bazaar people have the wrong box number. But can you
figure out the right one and retrieve the recipe yourself?

The key here is to work backwards. We don’t know what the chef answers to the
final question or whether he answers truthfully. But we do know that by the
time the interrogator asks it, he’s narrowed the options down to two
numbers– one where the second digit is 1, and one where it isn’t.
Our goal, then, is to find answers to the previous questions that lead to just
two possibilities. Of the three constraints offered, the one that narrows our
options the most is if the number is a perfect cube. That leaves us with only
eight answers between 13 and 1300. So let’s assume the answer to the third
question was a truthful YES.
Now, let’s look at the second question. If the chef answered YES to the
number being a perfect square, it would narrow the interrogator’s options to
just 64 and 729– the only numbers in our range that are both a square and a
cube. But neither of these has a 1 as the second digit. So the given answer to
the second question must’ve been NO. And that also means we can eliminate
these two squares from the interrogator's list, leaving only six numbers.
Now for the first question, which allows us to divide this list. If the chef
answered YES to the number being less than 500, we’d have four options, which
is too many. But a NO leaves us with two numbers greater than 500, one of which
does have a 1 as its second digit.
We don’t know which of these numbers the interrogator thinks is correct. But
that doesn’t matter– remember, his conclusion was based on lies. You, on
the other hand, are now in a position to reconstruct the truth.
First, the chef said the number was greater than 500 but lied, meaning it’s
actually less than 500. Second, the chef said it wasn’t a perfect square but
lied again, meaning the number is indeed a square. And finally, he truthfully
confirmed that it was also a cube. And as we’ve already seen, the only number
under 500 that’s both a square and a cube is 64.
You find the secret recipe and are gone before anyone’s the wiser. Corporate
espionage is not an easy game— but sometimes, that’s just how the sausage
is made.
