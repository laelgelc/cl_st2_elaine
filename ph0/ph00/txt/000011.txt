I'm Clint Smith and this is "Ode to the Only Black Kid in the Class." You, it
seems, are the manifestation of several lifetimes of toil. Brown v. Board in
flesh. Most days the classroom feels like an antechamber. You are deemed expert
on all things Morrison, King, Malcolm, Rosa. Hell, weren’t you sitting on
that bus, too? You are every- body’s best friend until you are not. Hip-hop
lyricologist. Presumed athlete. Free & Reduced sideshow. Exception and
caricature. Too black and too white all at once. If you are successful it is
because of affirmative action. If you fail it is because you were destined to.
You are invisible until they turn on the Friday night lights. Here you are star
before they render you asteroid. Before they watch you turn to dust.
