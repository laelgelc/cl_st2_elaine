Imagine a plane full of smoke. Imagine an engine going clack, clack, clack. It sounds scary. Well, I had a unique seat that day. I was sitting in 1D. I was the only one who could talk to the flight attendants. So I looked at them right away, and they said, &quot;No problem. We probably hit some birds.&quot; The pilot had already turned the plane around, and we weren&apos;t that far. You could see Manhattan. Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time. The pilot lines up the plane with the Hudson River. That&apos;s usually not the route. (Laughter) He turns off the engines. Now, imagine being in a plane with no sound. And then he says three words. The most unemotional three words I&apos;ve ever heard. He says, &quot;Brace for impact.&quot; I didn&apos;t have to talk to the flight attendant anymore. (Laughter) I could see in her eyes, it was terror. Life was over. Now I want to share with you three things I learned about myself that day. I learned that it all changes in an instant. We have this bucket list, we have these things we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people I wanted to reach out to that I didn&apos;t, all the fences I wanted to mend, all the experiences I wanted to have and I never did. As I thought about that later on, I came up with a saying, which is, &quot;I collect bad wines.&quot; Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I&apos;m opening it. I no longer want to postpone anything in life. And that urgency, that purpose, has really changed my life. The second thing I learned that day -- and this is as we clear the George Washington Bridge, which was by not a lot -- (Laughter) I thought about, wow, I really feel one real regret. I&apos;ve lived a good life. In my own humanity and mistakes, I&apos;ve tried to get better at everything I tried. But in my humanity, I also allow my ego to get in. And I regretted the time I wasted on things that did not matter with people that matter. And I thought about my relationship with my wife, with my friends, with people. And after, as I reflected on that, I decided to eliminate negative energy from my life. It&apos;s not perfect, but it&apos;s a lot better. I&apos;ve not had a fight with my wife in two years. It feels great. I no longer try to be right; I choose to be happy. The third thing I learned -- and this is as your mental clock starts going, &quot;15, 14, 13.&quot; You can see the water coming. I&apos;m saying, &quot;Please blow up.&quot; I don&apos;t want this thing to break in 20 pieces like you&apos;ve seen in those documentaries. And as we&apos;re coming down, I had a sense of, wow, dying is not scary. It&apos;s almost like we&apos;ve been preparing for it our whole lives. But it was very sad. I didn&apos;t want to go; I love my life. And that sadness really framed in one thought, which is, I only wish for one thing. I only wish I could see my kids grow up. About a month later, I was at a performance by my daughter -- first-grader, not much artistic talent -- (Laughter) Yet! (Laughter) And I&apos;m bawling, I&apos;m crying, like a little kid. And it made all the sense in the world to me. I realized at that point, by connecting those two dots, that the only thing that matters in my life is being a great dad. Above all, above all, the only goal I have in life is to be a good dad. I was given the gift of a miracle, of not dying that day. I was given another gift, which was to be able to see into the future and come back and live differently. I challenge you guys that are flying today, imagine the same thing happens on your plane -- and please don&apos;t -- but imagine, and how would you change? What would you get done that you&apos;re waiting to get done because you think you&apos;ll be here forever? How would you change your relationships and the negative energy in them? And more than anything, are you being the best parent you can? Thank you.
