Hi, Ted, talk daily listener. So we've been sharing podcasts from the TED audio collected for the last nine Fridays now and now, we thought we'd have a little bit of fun. You're about to hear another great episode of a TED podcast, but I can't tell you which one. We're randomly serving different episodes to our global audience. You can check back in later or on a different app and you might get something different. I can promise what you'll hear will be true to Ted, a curated podcast for the curious whether it's about business, design, science or philosophy. If you can handle the mystery. Stick around and to dive into our entire portfolio, head to audio collective Ted Dotcom. I'd love to know which episode you get, tweet at us or email podcasts at Ted Dotcom. We promise we read every message.
