You are all my patients. You injure your knee playing in the TED World Class Pickleball Championship or soccer. You come to me and say, "Doc, I injured my knee, I tore my ACL. Can you fix it?" And of course I say, "Sure, it's what I do every day. I love helping people with that injury." But, spoiler alert. It will take you a year to come back from that injury, and some of you may never come back. And it's not just you, it's every professional athlete. Why did it take Klay Thompson a year to come back and play for the Warriors? And you look at me incredulously. Aren't we in this stem cell world right now? Many of you have even tested this. You've had needles placed into your bone marrow and into your fat. You've gone to the Cayman Islands or Mexico and had your cells grown and injected them into your painful arthritic joints. Some of you have even injected them into your faces, and you do indeed look beautiful. (Laughter) But it's not quite enough to really accelerate your healing. So here's the science. So within each of you, you have tens of billions of stem cells. They live on the walls of your vessels. So the more vascular, the more cells you have. And yes, you have more when you're younger and fewer when you're older, but you still have tens of billions of these things. When you get that injury, there's a siren call out to the stem cell. The stem cell divides, it recreates a copy of itself and a daughter cell. And that daughter cell,  called a progenitor, rushes to the site of injury. And it's professorial. It directs the whole healing response. Itâ€™s potently anti-scarring, anti-inflammatory and potently stimulatory to stimulate that healing response. But it only happens on that initial injury. And it's not enough to really accelerate your repair over time. So the key is to find recruitment factors. And recruitment factors can be given to engage repetitive cellular responses. And that's the work that we're doing in our lab and our public nonprofit research foundation and other labs around the world. How do we create repetitive stimulus so that when you injure your knee next year and you come to me, we can have the conversation about how you can heal in days and weeks and not months and years? Artificial intelligence may or may not answer all of your questions, but biologic intelligence is what's going to permit you to take your injury and recover fitter, faster and stronger than you've been in years. And hopefully we can help you to drop dead at age 100 playing the sport you love. Thank you. (Applause)
