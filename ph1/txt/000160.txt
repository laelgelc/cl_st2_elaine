(Cheers) Helen Walters: I mean, I told you. Shu Takada: Thank you. HW: Shu, welcome to TEDNext. Thank you so much for being here. ST: Thank you very much for a nice opportunity.  HW: How did you get into yo-yoing? ST: So I'm Shu Takada from Japan. I’m a six-time world champion, as she introduced me. For me, yo-yo isn’t only a toy but also an art form and a tool that I can express myself [with] on the stage. Anyway, I started yo-yo when I was six years old because of my father, who did it as a hobby. When I saw his trick for the first time, I was so impressed and found it so cool. But to be honest, I felt a little bit jealous while he was showing off his techniques. And I swore to myself that one day I will surpass his level. So that's how I started yo-yo. HW: And what do you love about yo-yoing? ST: So what I love about yo-yoing is that you can express yourself with such a small tool, and you can bring it everywhere. You can play it everywhere. And I think this is really cool to make new friends all over the world, even though they can't speak the same language as you. HW: I love that. And what are you going to show us today? ST: So today, since my topic is beyond the yo-yo, I’d like to share a new style of yo-yoing, which you’ve never seen before. I hope you enjoy the performance, where your childhood pastime becomes art. Thank you. HW: Shu Takada, the stage is yours. Have fun.
